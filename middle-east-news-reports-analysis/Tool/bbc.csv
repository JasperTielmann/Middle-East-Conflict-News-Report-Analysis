BBC,7 days ago,"Even before the deadly blast at Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, Joe Biden's full-throated support for Israel had convinced Palestinians and millions of other Arabs that the United States was more than simply Israel's most important supporter. They believed the Americans were also complicit in everything Israel was doing in Gaza, including killing children.The bitter dispute over who was responsible for the attack will not change many minds. Twelve days of war have ramped up hatred and division.Israel produced a detailed rebuttal of accusations that it had attacked Al-Ahli. It displayed evidence that it said proved a missile fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad had malfunctioned and dropped well short of its target in Israel.For Palestinians - not just supporters of Hamas - the piles of bloodstained body bags were all the proof they needed. For them, the difference at Al-Ahli was not of principle but of degree. Israel has been killing scores of Palestinians every day since it responded to the Hamas surprise attack, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reminded Mr Biden had killed at least 1,400 people, mostly Israeli civilians. Al-Ahli was, for Palestinians, more proof of Israel's disregard for their lives.The first reports of the destruction of the hospital emerged as the engines of Air Force One were warming up to bring Joe Biden to the Middle East. Before it could take off his schedule was in tatters.President Biden has a deep commitment to Israel. It must have seemed natural to him to fly into Tel Aviv to show his support and offer a public embrace to Mr Netanyahu.Mr Biden had been hoping somehow to balance that out at a hastily-arranged summit in Amman, the Jordanian capital, where he planned to meet the king of Jordan, the president of Egypt and the Palestinian president.But Jordan cancelled because of Al-Ahli. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, hurried back to his HQ in Ramallah on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Jordan itself released statements condemning Israel.The trip became much harder for President Biden. Heads of state usually only travel on diplomatic missions once the hard work of negotiation has been done and a deal is ready to be signed.Coming to Tel Aviv was a gamble for President Biden. He wanted to ease Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, while supporting Israel's war effort - perhaps an impossible circle to square with Mr Netanyahu.But a deal emerged from their meeting. Israel was promised more military aid. In return it agreed to let convoys carrying food, water and medicine enter southern Gaza from Egypt. Hospitals are desperate for fuel for their generators, but when the deal was announced it was not mentioned.Apart from supporting the Israelis and reminding them to observe the laws of war, Mr Biden also wants to reinforce the message that the war must not spread. He had already deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the eastern Mediterranean, to show Iran and its ally in Lebanon, the Hezbollah militia and political movement, that they would have the US to reckon with if they intervened.One reason why leaders inside and outside the Middle East are struggling with the renewed war between Hamas and Israel is because they are in unknown territory. The old certainties had become comforting assumptions. But now they are mostly shattered and gone.The Middle East looked to be familiar ground before the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October. A status quo existed. No leader in the region, and among its allies, liked it much but at the very least it seemed to promise stability.Most Palestinians were as surprised as anyone else when Hamas attacked. Some had criticised Hamas for supposedly forgetting that its name is an Arabic acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement.Mr Netanyahu has been condemned by his many political enemies in Israel for being asleep on the job when Hamas invaded, and for presiding over a catastrophic military and intelligence failure. Israelis thought their government could keep them safe.Another illusion related directly to Mr Netanyahu was his assumption that the Palestinians could be managed without allowing them independence. Part of that involved making deals with Hamas over issues like the numbers of workers allowed back into Israel.At the same time, using a classic tactic of divide and rule, Mr Netanyahu worked to undermine the Palestinian Authority, the main rivals of Hamas for leadership of the Palestinians. The PA took part in years of ultimately fruitless peace talks, and recognised Israel a generation ago. But to get it talking again, Israel would have to discuss transferring land to the Palestinians for a future state with a capital in Jerusalem.That idea is out of the question for Mr Netanyahu in his current incarnation as the leader of a government sustained by extreme religious nationalists. His record suggests he has never wanted to make those concessions. It was easier for him to find a way to insist Israel had no partner for peace. Mr Netanyahu, or a successor, will have to change their thinking if they want to find a way to save the next generation from more war.For leaders of the US's Arab allies, there has also been a sharp reminder that the Palestinians cannot be ignored. Jordan and Egypt have long-established peace treaties with Israel. The UAE normalised relations in the Abraham Accords. All were hoping to benefit from Joe Biden's plan to create a new Middle East, and a foreign policy achievement to boast about, by brokering a deal in which Israel and Saudi Arabia would recognise each other in return for security guarantees from the US. Mr Biden's officials thought they were making progress. Now a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement is way off the agenda.And for Arab kings, princes and presidents, the war in Gaza and the attack on the hospital is also about the return of nightmares. At the end of 2010 a frustrated and furious market trader in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest against corrupt and bullying officials. It set off the Arab uprisings of 2011, which terrified leaders who thought they might lose everything - not just power and wealth but perhaps even their lives.If the death of an angry young man in Tunisia could be the spark for revolutions, what could be the price of a war that kills thousands of Palestinian civilians?Certainties have been shown, in less than two weeks of bloodshed, to be built on sand. The new status quo will emerge from war. Perhaps the shock it creates will force new thinking. If it simply reinforces the old ways, the outlook is grim.Correction 19th October: This article originally said that Al-Ahli hospital has been destroyed and has been amended to clarify that the building was the site of a deadly explosion.Are you in the region?

BBC,3-Oct,"Eid Haddad's parents were teenagers when they witnessed the full force of Britain's presence in Palestine in 1938.""They saw the troops coming in and attacking people. My father told me that one of the men was hit on his head with a wooden hammer used to mince meat called [in Arabic] a modakah, and he died,"" says Mr Haddad.""A man and his son were hanging tobacco leaves to dry them. They were just shot in the back.""""It was chaos,"" he says.His parents lived in al-Bassa, a Palestinian village subjected to collective punishment by British forces, who called their actions at the time ""punitive measures"". These would target whole villages if troops faced attacks by armed rebels operating in the hills.Mr Haddad gave the account of the atrocity for a new BBC Radio 4 series, The Mandates, starting on Tuesday at 1600BST, which examines how British and French control of the Middle East a century ago shaped the region in ways which still reverberate today.In the series we hear from a range of historians; experts in the events a century ago on the territory covering modern-day Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. We spoke to women and men directly affected by the convulsions that gripped Europe and the Middle East, and their descendants today.I first made contact with Mr Haddad last year when I was covering a Palestinian-led attempt to seek an apology for alleged war crimes carried out by the UK during its control of Palestine from 1917 to 1948.As I spoke to him this time, during calls from his home in Denmark, he recounted the story of his own childhood in Lebanon amid the further bloodshed his family endured - by then dislocated from their homeland.Like many other people I interviewed for the series, his parents' early lives unfolded as British and French rule sparked years of conflict and sectarian upheaval in the region.His childhood encapsulated the bloody instability that gripped the Middle East in the decades after the European powers abandoned their interventions.One historian we interviewed told us the history of the mandates is so foundational it is effectively ""a history of the present"".During the First World War, as Britain invaded and captured the territory from the crumbling Ottoman Empire, it drew on growing forces of national self-determination. It made competing promises over swathes of the territory to Arabs, who sought independence across the region, and to the Zionist movement which sought a Jewish home in Palestine.The British and French consolidated their control with so-called ""mandates"" to govern handed to them by the newly founded League of Nations - a body which was dominated by the two imperial powers.In Palestine, Britain's policies ultimately set rival national movements on a collision course before it launched a brutal crackdown on an Arab uprising in the late 1930s. British forces would later face rebellion from Zionist militias, amid a series of chaotic policy reversals which saw the UK renege on immigration promises and turn back refugee boats of Holocaust survivors who had earlier escaped Nazi-occupied Europe.""The British didn't know how to manage these things,"" the Israeli historian Tom Segev told me. ""[They] treated Palestine as one would treat a lovable pet. It's nice to have, but it really shouldn't cause us too much trouble,"" he adds.Meanwhile the French Mandate hived off Lebanon from Syria to create a strategic beachhead and imposed new boundaries over the whole territory in the early 1920s, before an Arab rebellion which they also ruthlessly suppressed. They split areas by ethnicity and religion in what historian James Barr told us was a ""very straightforward and cynical"" attempt to divide and rule.In the years after the Second World War, Britain and France pulled out. In Palestine, London knew its withdrawal would turn an escalating territorial conflict into regional war, as the State of Israel was declared and Arab armies invaded.Mr Haddad's parents fled al-Bassa as the village was destroyed by Jewish paramilitary forces. During the conflicts of 1947-8 at least 750,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what Palestinians call the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe'. Mr Haddad was born and grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in neighbouring Lebanon.The fragile sectarian climate between Christians and Muslims left in the wake of French rule of Lebanon was destabilised with the addition of Palestinian refugees. It was further aggravated during the rise of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the armed group that launched attacks on Israel. The country also had powerful officials who still favoured regional pan-Arab alliance with Syria and Egypt - a movement which drew its roots back to rebellion against the mandates and earlier.Lebanon later plunged into sectarian civil war. Mr Haddad, whose family are Palestinian Christians, describes how his 16-year-old brother was shot dead by Christian Lebanese ultranationalists - Phalangist militias - who targeted Palestinians and attacked his refugee camp north of Beirut in 1975.The following year, he survived a mass killing, escaping gunmen by hiding in a wardrobe. He describes appalling and barbaric humiliation of survivors by the militias.Mr Haddad tells me he manages lifelong symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which he traces back to what he experienced as a child.""My parents - I think they also suffered PTSD because they have seen also lots of things as children. And imagine my father, he was about to be taken by the British troops to be interrogated,"" he says, explaining that British forces separated women from men who were detained by troops during the atrocity in al-Bassa in 1938.His father, then a teenage boy, was spirited towards the line of women, says Mr Haddad, by a villager who disguised him as a girl.""So they just covered him, covered his head with a scarf and gave him a dress. And in this way, they saved him from being tortured,"" he says.The UK government has never acknowledged the atrocity in al-Bassa which is believed to have killed more than 30 people.From Europe, Mr Haddad describes how he has never been able to return home.He says: ""It feels like a big piece of myself is missing. I feel just like an island in an ocean which is totally foreign to me.""© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,10 hours ago,"This video can not be playedWatch: A day of violence and fearHamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 5,800 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes, including 2,300 children, and a ground offensive is expected soon.Hospitals in Gaza are stopping all but emergency services as fuel runs out, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The UN said on Tuesday that one third of hospitals and nearly two thirds of primary healthcare clinics in Gaza had already shut down due to damage from air strikes and a lack of fuel.Its aid agency on the ground, Unrwa, says food, water and fuel supplies remain critically low in Gaza, and that they will have to stop their work if they do not get fresh fuel supplies.Fifty-eight aid trucks or more have now entered the territory through the Rafah crossing with Egypt since Israel imposed a ""complete siege"" at the start of the conflict.However, this provides only a fraction of the needs of people in Gaza. Aid agencies say at least 100 truckloads of aid are needed every day.Fuel has not been included in the deliveries because Israel says it could be stolen and exploited by Hamas for military purposes.An estimated 1.4 million people in Gaza have been displaced, according to the UN.Hundreds of thousands moved from the north of the territory to the south, after being told by the Israeli military to leave for their own safety.The WHO has also warned that it is ""almost impossible"" for patients in hospitals in northern Gaza to be evacuated.The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to about 1.2 million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents.However, Israel has continued to carry out strikes on what it says are Hamas military targets in southern Gaza.Some of those who initially fled the north of Gaza are now returning because the situation in the south is so bad, the UN has said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said: ""We are working together as an iron fist for one objective - to eliminate Hamas.""Israel also wants to bring back the hostages that Hamas seized. Four have so far been released.US media are reporting that the Biden administration is asking Israel to delay the expected ground invasion of Gaza in order to buy time for more hostage negotiations.The Israeli military has been preparing for a ground operation by bombing hundreds of targets in the territory.It has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along the Gaza perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists, alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 people in its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.One of Israel's main targets is Hamas's vast labyrinth of underground tunnels, which contain bunkers for leaders and operational headquarters.Hamas has previously claimed the tunnels stretch for 500km (310 miles). Many have entrances hidden within houses, mosques, schools and other public buildings.Israel's troops are likely to avoid going into tunnels unless they have to, instead using explosives to destroy them.A major challenge for the Israeli troops will be close-quarters fighting in densely populated urban areas. It is thought that Hamas will lay booby traps and improvised explosive devices at entry points such as doorways, and along narrow streets.On Monday, the Israeli military said one Israeli soldier was killed and several others wounded during a raid into Gaza, to try and find hostages and to clear the way for a ground attack.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Tuesday that the Hamas attacks on 7 October had not happened ""in a vacuum"", adding that Palestinians ""had been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation"".His comments drew an angry response from Israeli officials, including Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who asked Mr Guterres ""in what world do you live?"" and later cancelled a meeting with him. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, called on the UN secretary general to resign.The leaders of the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy have supported Israel's right to defend itself but have called for ""adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians"".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that ""humanitarian pauses must be considered"" to protect civilians in Gaza.Hamas is a Palestinian group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state.Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks.In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers.Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily-fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders.It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation, according to the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military currently believes more than 200 people are being held in Gaza. They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world.Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip.Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland.Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist.Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation.He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,1 day ago,"The father of a 21-year-old Tanzanian, who has been missing since Hamas militants attacked the kibbutz he was living on in Israel, has told the BBC of his anguish, naming his son publicly for the first time.""The last time I spoke to Joshua was Thursday 5 October,"" says his father Loitu Mollel. ""I said, 'Be on your best behaviour because you're somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you're there to do.'""Two days later Joshua Mollel's new home - Kibbutz Nahal Oz - was attacked by Hamas.He had left his family's place in northern Tanzania just the previous month.Boarding the plane was a moment of excitement for Joshua.Not only was this his first time travelling abroad - it was also a big step towards making his ambitions a reality.""My son wants to make his fortune in agribusiness and become one of Tanzania's most successful farmers,"" his father says proudly.He and his wife hope Joshua's studies in Israel will eventually boost the modest incomes they make from teaching and growing crops.Being the eldest child, Joshua's younger brother and sisters look up to him as role model - so it hurts that they have not spoken to him on the phone for weeks.On 7 October dozens of residents were massacred in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, and hostages taken over the border to Gaza which lies just 800m away.Nobody knows what became of Joshua, and his family are sick with worry.""We can't eat or sleep - when I go to the market people ask me why I'm losing so much weight,"" says his father.""When the news came that Israel had been attacked by Hamas, I tried to find out if Israel had an embassy in Tanzania but I was told that they operate from Kenya.""So instead I contacted the Tanzanian foreign ministry and I even contacted Tanzania's ambassador in Tel Aviv.""But I've still received no information about where my child is and in what condition.""Neither Tanzania nor Israel have confirmed the identities of two Tanzanians students who are known to be missing.But the BBC has worked to establish who they are, speaking to their families to confirm details about their lives.We know that Joshua Mollel is one of the two missing students, and we know the identity of the other - but their parents have chosen not to name them publicly.""We are working in support of the Israel authorities to find out where the two missing students are,"" says Tanzania's ambassador in Tel Aviv, Alex Kallua. ""We can't tell if they are held hostage or even otherwise because we are looking for the correct information.""The BBC has also contacted Israel's foreign ministry with a request for comment.Some 350 Tanzanians live in Israel, 70% of whom are students mostly pursuing agricultural-related studies, according to Tanzanian officials.Ambassador Kallua says nine Tanzanians have returned to their home country safely within the last week, and that his embassy staff are ""keen to make sure that we are in touch with the other Tanzanians [who are still] in Israel and making sure all are safe"".Joshua's family says his internship at Nahal Oz's dairy farm in Israel was organised by his college in central Tanzania, the Ministry of Agriculture Training Institute - Katrin. The college has not replied to the BBC's request for comment.""We do not want to stand and blame the authorities for the slow search for my grandson, because we understand some parts of Israel were attacked by Hamas,"" Joshua's grandfather, Ephata Nanyaro, says diplomatically.But this does not lessen the family's pain.""He was last seen online on [the messaging app] WhatsApp on 7 October at around 10:00 [07:00 GMT] in the morning,"" recalls Joshua's father.""I'm so stressed... It is really difficult. My little girls ask me every morning and night: 'Dad, we want to talk to our brother.'""But I don't have any answers to give.""© 2023 BBC.

BBC,58 minutes ago,"Tory MPs have criticised a government bill which would ban public bodies from boycotting Israel as a ""violation of freedom of speech"" and ""draconian"".Ex-minister Kit Malthouse said it risked ""playing into the antisemitism"" that has increased in the UK recently.The bill imposes a ban on public bodies making their own direct or indirect boycotts, disinvestment or sanctions campaigns against other countries.Communities Secretary Michael Gove said it would help to fight antisemitism.The government says the bill would guarantee foreign policy remained a UK government matter.The Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill, known as the anti-BDS bill, seeks to prevent public bodies, including councils, from campaigning against, boycotting or sanctioning a particular international territory - unless that is endorsed by the UK government's own foreign policy.It aims to limit the reach of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for broad-based economic and cultural boycotts of Israel and Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.The BDS movement is widely backed by Palestinians and anti-occupation groups in the UK. Israel sees it as antisemitic - as do the United States and Germany - and has supported moves by other governments to outlaw such boycotts by public bodies. The issue is highly controversial, often sparking rows and protest among rival groups supportive of Israel or the Palestinians.The BDS says it opposes racism including Islamophobia and antisemitism.During a debate on the bill in Parliament a number of MPs including some Conservatives and a senior Labour MP strongly criticised the legislation.Former Home Office minister Mr Malthouse argued against a section of the legislation which would forbid public authorities to say they would back a boycott if it was lawful.""To not even be able to express opposition to the law whilst still complying with it seems to be very un-British, extremely illiberal and unnecessarily draconian,"" he said.Another former Conservative minister, George Eustice, said it was a ""violation of freedom of speech"".The bill gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the boycott restrictions.However, it does not allow the exemption of Israel, the Occupied Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights, specifically naming these areas in the legislation.Mr Malthouse told MPs: ""In carving out Israel, the West Bank and the occupied Golan Heights in the legislation, the secretary of state is, I'm afraid, playing into the antisemitism that we've seen rise in this country over the last few weeks.""Senior Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge also expressed a fear that the bill would strengthen polarisation at a time when the Israel-Gaza war had already heightened community tensions.She told MPs: ""To bring this wrong-headed, poorly-drafted politically-motivated bill back in the midst of these horrors we are seeing every day… is an act of complete irresponsibility and unbelievable foolishness.""Mr Gove robustly defended his bill, insisting it would not undermine free speech or prevent local authorities from taking into account human rights considerations when making decisions.He told MPs that the bill had the backing of the representative bodies that speak for Britain's Jewish community.He said: ""When they are so clear that this legislation is in the interests of community cohesion, fighting antisemitism, and making the United Kingdom a safe house for everyone, when they are so clear, we should treat their words with respect.""The bill was also backed by Conservative MP Theresa Villiers who said local authorities should be focused on ""delivering services not conducting their own foreign policy"".Another Tory, Andrew Percy, disagreed with MPs who said the bill should not be brought forward while tensions were running high. ""Are we waiting until Hamas give us permission,"" he asked.Amendments from Labour, Conservative and SNP MPs were defeated and the bill continues its progress through Parliament.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,1 day ago,"In a village lying close to the Mekong River, Weerapon ""Golf"" Lapchan sits in the centre of a group of Thai elders as they tie white threads around his wrists and chant.They are literally calling his ""kwan"" or spirit back to his body, after his narrow escape during the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.The 34-year-old is one of more than 25,000 Thais who were working on farms and orchards in Israel when the Hamas militants stormed in from Gaza. At least 30 Thais were among the 200 or so foreign nationals who were killed in the attack.Now the Thai government is helping others, thousands of them, to return home.Thailand provides almost all the foreign farm labour in Israel. And there have been warnings of dire consequences for the country's agricultural economy if large numbers of Thais choose to stay away after the Hamas attack. Many of the Thai workers have to borrow money to go to Israel and now they are returning, jobless and in debt.Yet some like Golf never want to go back.On the morning of 7 October, when Golf and his co-workers saw rockets being fired, and then intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defence system, he says they were not unduly worried.Golf had been working at an orange orchard in Yesha, just 5km (three miles) from the border with Gaza, for nearly a year. He had experienced rockets flying overhead before.When they heard gunfire, however, they realised it was more serious, and hid most of that day. In the evening, says Golf, the Hamas attackers returned, throwing grenades and setting the rooms where they were hiding alight. He and 11 others made a run for it. ""We jumped over the wall, and they shot at us from behind. Bang, bang, bang, bang.""He says he was wearing only a pair of red boxer shorts when he ran to the middle of the orchard. He and the others crouched down, turning off their phones so the attackers couldn't see the light.""We were all shocked and kept quiet all night - so quiet that we could hear the falling leaves,"" he says.Golf was brought back to Thailand on a government-organised evacuation flight on 13 October. He has decided he will not go back, no matter what he might be offered. Death was just seconds away that day, he says. All 12 of them have decided that they never want to face that again.At least 19 Thai workers are believed to have been abducted by Hamas, with many more still missing.In another village to the north, Narissara Chanthasang has had no news of her husband Nattapong since the morning of the attack. He had phoned her to tell her there was shooting, and that he was running away.He left her and his six-year-old son in June last year to work on an avocado and pomegranate farm in the Nir Oz kibbutz, not far from where Golf was working.Nir Oz was one of the communities worst affected by the attack. One in four of those who lived there are believed to have been killed or kidnapped by the militants, including many children.Narissara's only hope is that Nattapong may have been abducted, although he is not on the government's list of Thai hostages.People have always moved away from north-eastern Thailand in search of work.The mainly rural region is one of the poorest in the country, where rice farming provides only a bare subsistence living and well-paid jobs are scarce. More than 80% of Thai workers in Israel are from the north-east. They started going to Israel in the 1980s and the arrangement was formalised in an agreement between the two governments in 2011.It has not been without controversy. Human rights and labour groups have in the past complained about the Thais being overworked in unsafe conditions.People told the BBC they have to pay significantly more than the official fees of around 70,000 baht ($2,100) to get to Israel - often up to 120,000 baht including extra costs and unofficial payments. But they also say they can earn seven to eight times more than in Thailand. Some praised their Israeli employers for looking after them and paying them on time.""Partly it's about improving their social status,"" says Poonnatree Jiaviriyaboonya, an anthropologist at Nakhon Phanom University. ""Those who came back from working overseas get more respect. They seem more cosmopolitan, more educated. But in reality, [they] are still poor migrant workers, poor rice farmers who have been neglected by the government. We need to shake up our policies for developing this region so people do not have to leave their families and go overseas.""The debts they have incurred are a worry for those who have come back early. They borrow money against their land or their house - and they normally work in Israel for at least five years, so they can pay off what they owe.Golf's younger sister took out a loan for him to go last year. Narissara's mother mortgaged her rice-fields to raise the 200,000 baht they needed to send Nattapong to Israel.This is weighing on the mind of Anusorn Kamang, a 25-year-old whose mother also mortgaged her land for him to go to Israel.He spent a harrowing few days under constant rocket attack at the organic vegetable farm where he was working, before borrowing more money for his flight home.The Thai government has promised to reimburse that cost, but his mother's debt is still there, and he is thinking about going back, once the fighting stops.""I earned a lot in Israel, and my employer was good to me. Working here won't get me anywhere. It's enough for food, but that's all. I want a house and a car. I have none of that yet.""© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,4 hours ago,"Israel has demanded that the UN's secretary general retract comments he made about the Gaza war and apologise.António Guterres said in a speech to the Security Council on Tuesday that he condemned unequivocally Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel two weeks ago but that they ""did not happen in a vacuum"".Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan accused him of ""justifying terrorism"" and called for his immediate resignation.On Wednesday, Mr Guterres rejected ""misrepresentations"" of his statement.But Mr Erdan said in reply that the UN chief ""once again distorts and twists reality"", and called for his resignation.On 7 October, some 1,500 Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel from Gaza. They killed at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and took another 222 people as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 6,500 people have been killed in the territory since Israel retaliated with air and artillery strikes while massing troops for an expected ground invasion.This video can not be playedWatch: The BBC's Fergal Keane reports on the brutal impact on children in GazaAddressing a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York on Tuesday, Mr Guterres urged all parties in the war to respect and protect civilians.""I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians - or the launching of rockets against civilian targets.""He then told the council that it was ""important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum"", adding: ""The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation.""He described how Palestinians had ""seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished"".""But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""Mr Guterres also said he was deeply concerned about ""the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza"".He expressed alarm at Israel's continuous bombardment of Gaza, as well as the level of civilian casualties and ""wholesale destruction of neighbourhoods"".Without naming Hamas, he stressed that ""protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields"".And without naming Israel, he said: ""Protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than one million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself.""The UN chief also appealed for a humanitarian ceasefire to make the delivery of aid to Gaza easier and safer, and to facilitate the release of the hostages.He called the crossing from Egypt of 62 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies since Saturday ""a drop of aid in an ocean of need"".He warned that the failure to include fuel risked a disaster, explaining that hospitals would be left without power and drinking water would not be purified or pumped.The foreign minister of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, Riyad al-Maliki, demanded an end to what he called the ""ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel"" against the two million people living in Gaza.Visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen criticised Mr Guterres in his speech to the Security Council, asking him: ""In what world do you live?""Mr Cohen said the killing of 1,400 men, women and children by Hamas constituted a massacre that would ""go down in history as more brutal"" than those committed by the Islamic State (IS) group.""Hamas are the new Nazis,"" Mr Cohen declared. ""Just as the civilised world united to defeat the Nazis, just as the civilised world united to defeat [IS], the civilised world has to stand united behind Israel to defeat Hamas.""Addressing the UN's appeals for proportionality and a ceasefire, he said: ""Tell me, what is a proportionate response for killing of babies, for rape [of] women and burn them, for beheading a child? How can you agree to a ceasefire with someone who swore to kill and destroy your own existence?""Mr Cohen later wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: ""I will not meet with the UN secretary general. After the October 7th massacre, there is no place for a balanced approach.""This video can not be playedWatch: How Hamas' shock attack on Israel unfoldedMr Erdan said the secretary general had ""expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder"".On Wednesday, the ambassador was quoted by Israeli news website Ynet as saying he had informed the UN's Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths, that his request for an Israeli visa had been refused because of Mr Guterres's remarks.""He will not be able to come here to the region. Their agencies constantly need to bring in new people, certainly at a time like now. They will be refused.""A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said ""there is and can be no justification for Hamas's barbaric terrorist attack which was driven by hatred and ideology"".Later, Mr Guterres told reporters: ""I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement... as if, as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas. This is false. It was the opposite.""""I believe it was necessary to set the record straight, especially out of respect to the victims and to their families,"" he added.But Mr Erdan said it was a ""disgrace to the UN that the secretary general does not retract his words and is not even able to apologise for what he said yesterday"".""Every person understands very well that the meaning of his words is that Israel has guilt for the actions of Hamas or, at the very least, it shows his understanding for the 'background' leading up to the massacre,"" he said.""A secretary general who does not understand that the murder of innocents can never be understood by any 'background' cannot be secretary general...

BBC,2 days ago,"It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people.Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen.The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers:Israel said it was imposing a ""complete siege"" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this ""humanitarian for humanitarian"".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Rosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (""mowing the grass"" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: ""Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.""Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified ""Western position"" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.""Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11"" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,10-Oct,"A letter from Harvard University student groups blaming Israel for violence in the region has drawn a backlash from prominent alumni and US lawmakers.The letter, authored by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee, stated that students ""hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence"".It was co-signed by 33 student groups.""Today's events did not occur in a vacuum,"" the statement said.""The apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years,"" the letter added.The letter comes after Israel says 1,000 people have been killed and 100 kidnapped since Hamas militants launched a surprise attack in the early hours of Saturday. In Gaza, more than 700 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes.The student statement, posted on Saturday, was swiftly rebuked by some professors as well as former Harvard president Larry Summers, who wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he was ""sickened"" by it.""The silence from Harvard's leadership, so far, coupled with a vocal and widely reported student groups' statement blaming Israel solely, has allowed Harvard to appear at best neutral towards acts of terror against the Jewish state of Israel,"" the former US treasury secretary said.Harvard University issued its own letter on Monday that did not directly address the controversy but instead said university leaders were ""heartbroken"" by ""the attack by Hamas that targeted citizens in Israel this weekend, and by the war in Israel and Gaza now under way"".This video can not be playedUS Democrat: 'We should be aiding Israel militarily, diplomatically'In another statement issued later on Tuesday, the university's president, Claudine Gay, clarified that the school ""condemn[ed] the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas"".""Such inhumanity is abhorrent, whatever one's individual views of the origins of longstanding conflicts in the region,"" she said.She added that while students had the right to ""speak for themselves"", none had the right to speak on behalf of Harvard.Mr Summers' criticisms, meanwhile, were echoed by several Republican US lawmakers, including Harvard alumni Ted Cruz who wrote on X: ""What the hell is wrong with Harvard?""Harvard Computer Science professor Boaz Barak also took to social media to condemn the letter, asking the university to remove the student groups' school affiliations.""I have a lot of criticisms of Israeli policies, but everyone who signed this statement is condoning terrorism, rape, and murder,"" he said.The University's Jewish centre, Harvard Hillel, claimed the statement was a sign of ""further hatred and anti-Semitism"".The groups that signed onto the letter - which called on Harvard to ""stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians"" - included the Harvard Law School Justice for Palestine, the Harvard Jews for Liberation and the Harvard South Asian Law Students Association.In a post on Instagram, the author of the statement, the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee, said its account had been temporarily suspended after posting the letter.The group called the move ""a recurring pattern of Meta's censorship of pro-Palestine messaging"".© 2023 BBC.

BBC,2 days ago,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says more than 220 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 5,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to Gaza's health ministry. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation.Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One.The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups.Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people.This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city.That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the ""Catastrophe""By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory.Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza.Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on.These include:Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented.Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called ""the deal of the century"" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities.Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition.It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,1 day ago,"The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has accused Israel of a ""clear breach"" of international law in Gaza.He told the BBC there was ""no justification for the withholding of essential supplies"" from the people of Gaza.His comments came amid resignations within the party over Sir Keir Starmer's stance on the crisis.The Labour leader has repeatedly insisted Israel has a right to defend itself within international law.More than 1,400 Israelis have been killed since Hamas launched its attack on 7 October, according to Israeli authorities - the vast majority in the initial assault. More than 220 are believed to have been taken hostage inside Gaza.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's air strikes began in response, and according to the Palestinian health ministry in the occupied West Bank, 91 Palestinians have been killed there since 7 October.Speaking after an Institute for Government event in London, Mr Sarwar said: ""There is no justification for the withholding of essential supplies; water, electricity, medicine and food from the people of Gaza. It is a clear breach of international law.""""There is no grey area. International law is clear. Withholding of water, energy and essential supplies is a breach of international law and therefore there must be a immediate humanitarian corridor opened so that is accessed by the people in Gaza.""He said he made his remarks ""whilst unequivocally condemning Hamas"" and called for ""a de-escalation of violence"" and the end of  ""rocket fire coming into and out of Gaza"".""We must condemn Hamas but we cannot pretend that Hamas is the Palestinian people,"" he added.Mr Sarwar's comments come amid a number of resignations of Labour party members and elected officials across the UK, including 15 officials in Scotland.Nine officers in a Glasgow ward, including a Labour peer, and six in Edinburgh stood down earlier this week.The Glasgow Kelvin officers accused Scottish Labour of ""stifling democracy"" after a motion calling for an end to military action was ruled out of order.Asked about Labour officers resigning their positions in Glasgow and Edinburgh constituency Labour parties (CLPs), Mr Sarwar said he disputed claims the party was stifling debate.""I don't want to trivialise the issue by talking about individual CLPs… it's being talked about nationally and right across the country,"" he said.Two councillors who resigned from the party in Oxford have objected to comments made by Sir Keir on a radio programme earlier this month.Pressed at the time on whether cutting off water and power supplies into Gaza would be appropriate as part of an Israeli response, he said: ""I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation.""Obviously, everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself,"" he added.Sir Keir later clarified those comments by explaining he was speaking about Israel's right to defend itself, not to cut off power and water, and that Israel should respond within international law.Meanwhile, the first minister has said his mother-in-law, who is stuck in Gaza, has ""lost hope"".Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged travelled to the region before the Hamas attack and subsequent Israeli reprisals left them trapped.In a statement in the Scottish Parliament, Humza Yousaf reiterated calls for a ceasefire, an increase in aid and a global refugee settlement scheme to be created for those who wish to flee.Speaking about his in-laws, Mr Yousaf said he and his wife Nadia could barely sleep for worry.""Throughout the day, the 100 people in the family home must ration their food.

She told me she feels as if the UK Government has forgotten about her.""Please don't interpret my point as a political one, it is not,"" he added.Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said his party ""stands with Israel"", but also with civilians in Gaza, saying: ""The Palestinian people are not Hamas.""They are civilians, they are innocent, they are simply caught in a terrible situation.

BBC,20-Jul,"Former Prime Minister Tony Blair viewed Northern Ireland as ""similar to the Middle East"" with people focusing on ""the bad without taking the gains into account"".He made the comments during a meeting in January 2002 with Northern Ireland church leaders.Confidential minutes of the talks have been released by the National Archive.During the meeting Mr Blair was also told that Protestant churches ""had lost touch with working class communities"".The National Archive's documents include briefing notes prepared by officials for the prime minister and subsequent minutes of the meeting, which took place on 24 January 2002.That month had seen continuing violence in Northern Ireland, especially in north Belfast, and the murder of Catholic postman Danny McColgan.Mr Blair and the then Secretary of State Dr John Reid met the leaders of the four main churches to talk about a range of issues including the Drumcree parade, sectarianism, the Northern Ireland health service and claims that NI was a ""cold place for Protestants"".It was the first time Mr Blair had hosted the leaders at Downing Street.The church leaders at the meeting were Archbishop Robin Eames from the Church of Ireland, the Reverend Alastair Dunlop from the Presbyterian Church, Cardinal Sean Brady from the Roman Catholic Church and Rev Harold Good from the Methodist Church.Two other delegates - one from the Presbyterian Church and one from the Methodist Church - were also there.The minutes of the meeting were written by Northern Ireland-born Francis Campbell, then a Downing Street official.In a briefing to Mr Blair dated 22 January, two days before the breakfast meeting, Mr Campbell said that it would be a way of ""encouraging the leaders in their ecumenical dialogue"".""It will give them a boost to face down those in Northern Ireland who have little time for ecumenical activity,"" he wrote.Mr Campbell also expressed concerns that as the only Catholic leader, Cardinal Brady ""might feel somewhat isolated if the discussion becomes too political"".""Brady is a southerner and might be intimidated by the experience of meeting the British PM in Number 10,"" Mr Campbell continued.The briefing for Mr Blair also noted that health was ""a subject of acute controversy in Northern Ireland"".Mr Campbell wrote a subsequent account of the meeting for a Northern Ireland Office official, Kirsten McFarlane, on 25 January.According to that account, Archbishop Eames told Mr Blair that the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 needed to be explained ""to ordinary people"".""Alastair Dunlop echoed that,"" the document said.""The problem was that the churches had lost touch with working class communities.""The churches, in particular the Protestant churches, needed to find ways of addressing the loss of confidence in the GFA and they needed government support to achieve that.""In response, Mr Blair said: ""The unionist community needed to get the main message of the GFA - that Northern Ireland was in the UK on the basis of consent and subject to the will of the majority.""The notions of constant concessions to one side had to be challenged.""Northern Ireland was similar to the Middle East - people focused on the bad without taking the gains into account,"" he continued.Archbishop Eames then raised the disputed Drumcree parade.""He said that unless it was settled it could derail the entire peace process.""When matters moved on to policing, Cardinal Brady told the prime minister that ""the perception within the Catholic community was that the police were interested in security crime and not focused on tackling pipe bombers or everyday criminality"".During subsequent discussions, according to Mr Campbell's minutes, Dr Reid said the police faced ""a real difficulty"" on pipe bombings.""The perpetrators were often teenagers with little central organisation,"" he added.""The UDA was not like PIRA (Provisional IRA) and tackling it without internment was very difficult.""According the minutes Cardinal Brady also raised conditions for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, the military prison established by the USA after the attacks of September 11 2001.Mr Blair assured him that British prisoners were ""being well treated"" but said that information from them was ""vital if further attacks were to be averted"".The declassified government papers released by the National Archives are mainly from 2001 and 2002, but also include some documents from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,28-Feb,"Shipments of toxic waste from the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment have resumed after a brief pause, environmental officials have said.A total of 38 cars derailed in the 3 February incident, including 11 carrying hazardous materials.Solid and liquid waste from the site are now being shipped to specialised facilities.Over the weekend, officials said that the air quality in the town is normal, despite ongoing fears from residents.On 25 February, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it was ordering a temporary halt on shipments of contaminated waste from the site.An EPA regional administrator, Debra Shore, said that stopping the shipments would allow officials to ""ensure that all waste is disposed of in a safe and lawful manner"" at approved facilities. Some waste had already been shipped to facilities in Texas and Michigan.On Sunday, Ms Shore announced the EPA planned to begin shipping liquid waste to an underground injection well, while solid waste would go to an incinerator.

""There're so many unanswered questions, and they know this isn't the last of this conversation.""The derailment and subsequent response have become a politically contentious issue in the US, with lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum trading accusations of blame.According to US news outlets, including Axios and CNN, Republicans in the House of Representatives plan to launch investigations into the derailment.This video can not be playedWatch: Anger erupts at Ohio train crash town meetingLast week, James Comer - the chair of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee - sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg urging him to ""provide transparency"" on the incident.

BBC,19-May,"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has spoken of an ""historic opportunity"" for Arab states to remake their region ""with the least amount of foreign interference"", in his first trip to an Arab League summit in over a decade.He said Arab leaders should build on the reconciliation ahead of the summit.Syria had been suspended from the group at the start of its civil war in 2011.It was readmitted after states which had backed the opposition accepted Mr Assad's grip on power was secure.""I hope that it marks the beginning of a new phase of Arab action for solidarity among us, for peace in our region, development and prosperity instead of war and destruction,"" he told delegates.""Today is an historic opportunity to rearrange our affairs with the least amount of foreign interference,"" he added.Meanwhile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also invited to the summit, accused some Arab leaders of wilfully ignoring to Russia's invasion. Syria is the only Arab League nation to have openly supported Russia's war.""Unfortunately, there are some in the world and here among you who turn a blind eye to those [prisoner of war] cages and illegal annexations,"" he told delegates.Mr Assad's appearance had been highly anticipated since he was invited by Saudi Arabia to attend only last week.He was given a warm welcome, receiving a hug from his Saudi host, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi Arabia had for years supported rebel groups fighting to overthrow President Assad, with money and arms. However this was reduced as jihadist groups became more powerful and Mr Assad crushed the rebels following Russia's intervention in 2015.At a meeting of the foreign ministers of the 22 member states on Wednesday, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit declared that he hoped that ""Syria's regaining of its seat is a precursor to the end of its conflict"".But not every country was enthusiastic about Syria's reinstatement.Qatar's foreign minister told a news conference in Doha that it had dropped its opposition only because it did not want to ""deviate from the Arab consensus"".The US meanwhile said it did ""not believe that Syria merits readmission"".""Our position is clear - we are not going to normalise relations with the Assad regime, and we certainly don't support others doing that as well,"" state department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.Syria's return to the Arab League has also been denounced by ordinary citizens opposed to the government.""How many people were killed? How many people were imprisoned? How many people were tortured to death?"" teacher and activist Abdulkafi Alhamdo, who was forced to flee his home in the Syrian city of Aleppo, told the BBC's Newshour programme.""What happened - by allowing Assad to join this Arab League meeting - is unbelievable and cannot be forgiven by the next generations.""There has been a growing rapprochement between Arab states and Syria, which accelerated following the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and north-western Syria in February. In the wake of the disaster once-hostile powers sent humanitarian aid to Syrian government-controlled areas.China also brokered a surprise agreement in March that saw Saudi Arabia restore diplomatic ties with its long-time regional rival Iran, which along with Russia has helped Mr Assad's forces regain control of Syria's biggest cities.Large parts of the country are nevertheless still held by Turkish-backed rebels, jihadists, and Kurdish-led militia fighters supported by the United States.About half a million people have been killed in the war and half of Syria's pre-war population of 22 million have had to flee their homes. Some 6.8 million people are internally displaced, while another 6 million are refugees or asylum-seekers abroad.Even before the earthquake struck an estimated 15.3 million people inside Syria were in need of some form of humanitarian assistance - an all-time high since the war began.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,6 days ago,"US President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Egypt to deliver limited aid to Gaza to ease a humanitarian crisis amid the Israel-Hamas war.Visiting Tel Aviv, Mr Biden said Israel had a right to hit back for the Hamas attack that triggered the fighting.The US president said Israel had been ""badly victimised"", though he cautioned against being ""consumed"" by rage.He also backed Israel's account that a blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday was not caused by an Israeli air strike.Palestinian officials say the explosion at Gaza's Al-Ahli Arab Hospital killed 471 people, blaming it on Israel. The incident has further inflamed tensions across the region.This video can not be playedBiden says he is ""outraged and saddened"" by the loss of lifeBut during a trip to Tel Aviv lasting fewer than eight hours on Wednesday, Mr Biden supported the Israeli claim that the deadly blast appeared to have been caused by a misfiring Palestinian rocket.The American president said he was ""deeply saddened and outraged"" by the explosion.Israel has pointed the finger at Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad denied any role in the blast.The Palestinian-reported death toll has also been disputed by Israel. A foreign ministry spokesman, Lior Haiat, said on social media platform X that ""several dozen people"" had been ""apparently killed"".While flying home, Mr Biden discussed aid for Gaza with Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi by phone.Mr Biden told journalists that Mr Sisi had agreed to open the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza to allow about 20 lorries carrying humanitarian aid into the territory.Egypt confirmed its president and Mr Biden had agreed to provide aid to Gaza ""in a sustainable manner"".Mr Biden did not give a timeline for the border crossing opening, but White House spokesman John Kirby said it would occur in the coming days after road repairs.This video can not be playedWatch: Chaos in Gaza City after hospital hitMr Biden also said $100m (£82m) in US funding would be be allocated to support Palestinian civilians.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters news agency the US president was considering asking Congress for $10bn in aid for Israel as soon as Friday.People are desperately short of food, water, fuel, medicine and other essentials after Israel launched a blockade of the enclave 10 days ago.Israel struck back after the Palestinian militant group Hamas killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented incursion from Gaza on 7 October.At least 3,000 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials.

Nearly 200 people have been abducted, Israel says.Mr Biden will give a televised address to the nation from the White House on Thursday at 20:00 EDT (midnight GMT).In his address, Mr Biden will ""discuss our response to Hamas's terrorist attacks against Israel and Russia's ongoing brutal war against Ukraine"", White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said.Also on Thursday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is due to visit Israel.On the US president's high-stakes visit to Tel Aviv, he was warmly greeted by Mr Netanyahu, before the pair hosted a joint news conference.Mr Biden likened the Hamas raid on Israel to the 9/11 attacks in the US.""The scale may be different, but I'm sure those horrors have tapped into some kind of primal feeling in Israel, just like it did and felt in the United States,"" Mr Biden said. ""But I caution this: while you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it.""After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.""Addressing the explosion at the hospital, Mr Biden told Mr Netanyahu: ""Based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you.""Mr Biden was later asked by reporters what led him to conclude that Israel was not responsible, and said: ""The data I was shown by my defence department.""A senior American official has told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that Washington has its own intelligence - in addition to Israel's - that includes communications intercepts and satellite photos, which give it ""high confidence"" Israel was not behind the strike.The official said there were ""indications"" that it was an errant rocket fired by a group in Gaza.Mr Biden had planned to travel from Israel to Jordan to meet King Abdullah, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egypt's President Sisi, but that leg of the trip was called off after the hospital blast.Jordan cancelled the meeting and condemned what it called ""a great calamity and a heinous war crime"".The White House said the decision to call off that part of the visit had been ""made in a mutual way"".© 2023 BBC.

BBC,18-Oct,"For days now, Israel has signalled that its massed forces are poised to go into Gaza with the aim of eliminating Hamas as a military force once and for all, following its raid into southern Israel on 7 October.Over 300,000 reservists have been called up for the IDF (Israel Defence Forces). The farms, fields and kibbutzim on the Israeli side of the Gaza border are crowded with Merkava tanks, self-propelled artillery systems and thousands of heavily armed infantry in full battle dress.The Israeli Air Force and Navy have been pounding every suspected Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad hideout and weapons store in Gaza, killing and wounding large numbers of civilians in the process, as well as a small number of Hamas commanders.The massive number of casualties caused by Tuesday's explosion at a central Gaza hospital, blamed and denied by both sides, will only have inflamed tensions in the region even further.So why hasn't Israel begun its promised incursion into Gaza?There are several factors involved here.The hurriedly-planned visit of President Joe Biden to Israel this week is an indication of how worried the White House is about the deteriorating situation. Washington has two big concerns: the escalating humanitarian crisis and the risk of this conflict spreading across the Middle East.The US president has already made clear his opposition to any Israeli return to an occupation of Gaza, which it withdrew from in 2005. This, he said, would be ""a big mistake"".Officially he has been visiting Israel to show strategic support for America's closest Middle East ally and to hear of Israel's plans for Gaza.Unofficially, he is likely to be urging some restraint on the hardline government of Benjamin Netanyahu. The US would like to know how, if Israel goes into Gaza, it plans to get out, and when.Any prospect of Israel launching a full-scale military invasion of Gaza while Airforce One is sitting parked on the tarmac in Tel Aviv would not be a good look, for either the US or Israel.In a visit overshadowed by the deadly blast at Gaza's Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, President Biden publicly backed Israel's version of events, that a mis-fired Palestinian rocket caused the explosion. Palestinian officials say an Israeli air strike hit the hospital. The BBC is working to independently verify the death toll, which is feared to be in the hundreds, as well as the cause of the explosion.In the last few days, Iran has issued stern warnings that Israel's assault on Gaza cannot go unanswered. So what does that mean in practice?Iran funds, trains, arms and to some extent controls a number of Shi'a militias in the Middle East. By far the most potent of these is Hezbollah in Lebanon, sitting just across from Israel's northern border.The two countries fought a damaging and inconclusive war in 2006 which saw Israel's modern battle tanks knocked out by hidden mines and well-planned ambushes. Since then, Hezbollah has rearmed with Iranian help and is now thought to have close to 150,000 rockets and missiles, many of which are long-range and precision-guided.There is an implicit threat here that if Israel invades Gaza then Hezbollah may open up a new front on Israel's northern border, forcing it to fight a war on two fronts.It is by no means certain, however, that Hezbollah wants this war at this time, especially with two US Navy carrier strike groups sailing just offshore in the eastern Mediterranean and ready to come to Israel's aid.This will give Israel some reassurance that any attack by Hezbollah could potentially invoke a devastating retaliation from US naval air power. It is worth remembering though that at the start of Israel's last war with Hezbollah in 2006 the militants were able to hit an Israeli warship offshore with one of their sophisticated anti-ship missiles.The Israeli government's concept of a humanitarian crisis tends to lag behind the rest of the world's when it comes to rooting out Hamas from Gaza.As the death toll amongst Palestinian civilians mounts as a result of relentless Israeli airstrikes, much of the global sympathy for Israel after the barbaric and bloodthirsty actions of Hamas on 7 October has been replaced by a rising clamour to stop the air strikes and protect ordinary Gazans.If and when Israeli ground forces go into Gaza in strength, then the death toll will only rise further.Israeli soldiers will die too, from ambushes, snipers and booby traps - much of the fighting may even take place below ground, in miles of tunnels.But it is likely that, once again, it will be the civilian population that will bear the brunt of the casualties.Israeli intelligence has had a bad month.Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence agency, has taken the rap for the failure to spot Hamas's initial deadly attack coming. It is supposed to have a network of informants and spies inside Gaza, keeping tabs on commanders from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Yet what happened on that horrific Saturday morning in southern Israel amounted to the worst intelligence failure in the nation's history since the Yom Kippur war in 1973.Israeli intelligence will have been frantically trying to make amends over the last 10 days, helping the IDF identify names and locations of hostages as well as where Hamas commanders are hiding.It is possible that they have asked for more time to gather more information so that if and when ground forces do go in, then they can head directly to a specific location, rather than wandering around the ruins and rubble of northern Gaza facing constant attack, amid rising condemnation from much of the world.Those elements of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad that are still operational after the sustained Israeli bombing campaign will have planned ambushes and traps for any advancing Israeli troops. These will be particularly hazardous in the underground tunnels. Israeli intelligence will be keen to discover their locations and warn the IDF accordingly.© 2023 BBC.

There's also a sign saying ""Bibi must resign"" - the nickname Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is widely known by in Israel.Mr Netanyahu is not seeing the public support that often swells around wartime leaders. Opinion polls show a majority of Israelis think he should stand down when the conflict is over.His approval rating has slumped and a survey of Jewish voters last week showed two thirds would opt for someone else.There is anger about the security failure that allowed Hamas to kill so many people and take 200 hostages.The Albaghs are, like so many hostage families, wary of stepping into politics or criticising the leaders they are relying on to save their daughter, but their faith in their country has been shaken.""We want the government to put its attention…to talk with them (Hamas) to release the kidnapped"", Eli says.Shira says she holds Israel responsible for failing to keep her daughter safe but also the rest of the world for not recognising the threat of Hamas.She remains confident that Israel will bring the hostages home, somehow. Polling shows support for the military is still strong.Mr Netanyahu, the longest-serving Israeli leader, had already faced months of divisive protests over planned constitutional changes. He is also charged with corruption.""He (Netanyahu) is evil"" declares Slomit Kobner, who has just been told her friend Mayanna Herschovitz's body has been found in her kibbutz near Gaza.""He cannot lead Israel. I don't see any way he or his government can stay. The pain is so bad.""In a text message at 11:15 local time (08:15 GMT) on the morning of the attacks, Mayanna said her family had been hiding from gunmen for more than three hours but the army still hadn't arrived to save them.That is the last Slomit heard from her friend - she was hoping they'd been kidnapped.Slomit is left wing and has protested against Mr Netanyahu for years: ""Now everybody in Israel knows that he can't be anymore the prime minister after this,"" she says.""He can go now, or he can go after.""Mr Netanyahu, 73, has served three times as prime minister over 16 years in office. He casts himself as a strong man dedicated to national security.His own brother was killed in action leading a successful special forces raid - Operation Entebbe - to rescue Israeli hostages held in Uganda after the hijacking of a flight from Tel Aviv in 1976.But in this crisis Mr Netanyahu has been criticised for being slow to embrace the families of hostages but quick to turn to the US for support.Families are waiting to hear how the kidnapped will be returned. Many Israelis wonder exactly how the declared ""war on Hamas"" will be fought.Even longstanding supporters are questioning Mr Netanyahu's future.""The leadership have failed, they're in a very bad position"" says Dor Harlap, who co-chairs a Jewish cultural organisation called Zionist Horizon.""After the war he should go to the public with the results of the war and ask for another chance. I'm not sure the public will give it to him. I'd vote for him but maybe this is the last session of Netanyahu.""This year's demonstrations - the largest in Israel's history - followed years of restive politics and three prime ministers in 18 months.Dor, a committed Likud party voter, worries aging leaders are growing out of touch but wants responsibility taken more collectively.""The right wing and the left wing had the same agenda about Hamas and Gaza in the last 10 or 15 years. Maybe we should have new leadership for all of the parties.""He's also critical of the widespread protests against Mr Netanyahu's judicial reforms.Thousands of reserve servicemen and woman threatened to join the revolt by refusing their orders because of concerns the plan to limit the checks and balances of Israel's supreme court would undermine Israel's democracy. Israel's president warned the country was heading for civil war.""Our enemies see that we are divided,"" Dor says.""They see that in the military itself there are protestors and people who wouldn't agree to serve. They've been waiting for our weak point and this instability of the government isn't good for us.""At the family's vigil, a car draws up and a man shouts that the months of protest have undermined national unity and let Hamas capitalise. A crowd gathers and a woman screams back as the police step in.""This man tells me Bibi [Netanyahu] is the king, he's the best man in the world… I can't bear it"" she says, enraged.""I have no country, I have only people. I wish they [Hamas] took Bibi instead of the children and all his government because they are not doing anything.

BBC,5 days ago,"This video can not be playedBiden: Abandoning Israel and Ukraine 'not worth it'US President Joe Biden has said world history is at ""an inflection point"" as he made the case for billions of dollars in wartime aid for Ukraine and Israel.In a speech at the White House, he said Hamas and Russia both wanted to ""annihilate a neighbouring democracy"".Mr Biden said he would send an urgent funding request - expected to be $105bn (£87bn) - to Congress on Friday.But the House of Representatives has no leader and can't approve any spending.Mr Biden's rare primetime address to the nation from the Oval Office on Thursday evening was just the second of his presidency.It came a day after his whirlwind trip to Israel following the attacks by Hamas on 7 October.Mr Biden said the emergency aid request would ""pay dividends for American security for generations"".In his 15-minute address, he also condemned any acts of hatred against Jews or Muslims in the US, and condemned the fatal stabbing of six-year-old Palestinian-American Wadea al-Fayoume in Chicago this week.""We must without equivocation denounce anti-Semitism,"" he said. ""We must also without equivocation denounce Islamophobia.""The White House has not yet officially released details about the expected aid package.But a source familiar with the request told the BBC's US partner CBS News it would include:Mr Biden also took great care to stress his sympathy for the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as talking about meeting the families of Israeli and US victims of the Hamas attacks.Democrats hope that by tying the different aid packages together they can win support for the Ukraine funding, which some Republicans oppose.But the request will arrive at an effectively frozen Congress, as House Republicans have been unable to elect a Speaker after Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a right-wing revolt more than two weeks ago.Mr Biden, who is a Democrat, did not explicitly address the political dysfunction, though he acknowledged ""divisions at home"".""We have to get past them,"" he said. ""We can't let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibility as a great nation.""We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen.""But it is unclear if the spending package would pass Congress, even with a House Speaker.The Republican leader of the Senate has indicated willingness to take up the measure, but there is opposition within the party.Eight Republicans, led by Kansas Senator Roger Marshall, wrote in a letter: ""These are two separate and unrelated conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in an attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line.""Ohio Republican Senator JD Vance called Mr Biden's linking of the two conflicts ""disgusting"".""He's using dead children in Israel to sell his disastrous Ukraine policy,"" he posted on X, formerly Twitter, after the speech.There was even a sign of dissent within the Biden administration on Thursday as a state department official resigned in protest at the US decision to keep sending weapons to Israel as it lays siege to Gaza.Josh Paul, who headed the bureau that oversees arms transfers, told the BBC after quitting that he believed Israel's actions violated US legal provisions meant to restrict weapons sales to human rights abusers.""I think our mechanisms for determining violations are broken,"" he said.This video can not be playedWatch: US official quits over Israel aid: 'I had to resign'Additional reporting by Phil McCausland and Max Matza© 2023 BBC.

BBC,17-Oct,"President Joe Biden's decision to visit Israel caps a week of intense US diplomacy aimed at shoring up its closest Middle East ally and trying to prevent Israel's war with Hamas from spreading to the region.The Americans are worried that the audacity of the Hamas attack and the ferocity of the Israeli counter-offensive could spark violence in the West Bank and beyond.The president will be joining his Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who's been on a frantic swing through the Middle East. Mr Blinken has stressed full US support for a forceful response to the deadly Hamas raid, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.But he is also trying to mitigate the civilian casualties in Gaza, the enclave that is governed by the Palestinian militant group. Israel has already killed nearly 3,000 Palestinians in relentless airstrikes, and blocked food, water and electricity to Gaza, plunging it into a humanitarian crisis.""Blinken is trying to thread the needle,"" says David Schenker, the state department's former top diplomat for the Middle East. ""So far, he seems to have managed it relatively well. But it becomes more and more challenging.""Mr Blinken's emphasis on protecting civilians grew during his whirlwind tour of America's Arab allies at the end of last week, visiting six countries in three days.He wanted them to clearly condemn Hamas for the unprecedented scale and brutality of the attack, and hoped to limit criticism of Israel's military campaign.Only two Arab governments - Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates - denounced Hamas. Others may have done so privately, because most are hostile to Hamas in varying degrees.In public, though, they focused on the humanitarian tragedy already unfolding in Gaza.A lengthy Israeli ground operation could inflame their populations, who support the Palestinian cause, threatening stability in their countries and narrowing the diplomatic room that Arab heavyweights such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia have to calm the situation.Egypt was the most outspoken. Its President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi told Mr Blinken that Israel's military operations had already exceeded ""the right of self-defence"" and turned into collective punishment.In this environment, some analysts questioned whether Mr Biden's trip to show solidarity with Israel could be seen as provocative. Others suggested it might help to underline a private message of restraint, should the president choose to deliver one.""He's a very visceral politician,"" says Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. ""It may be that he feels that if you're going to push the Israelis, you can't push them until you've already made clear that you care.""Mr Biden will also be meeting the Egyptian leader along with Jordan's King Abdullah and the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman to discuss humanitarian issues.This follows the administration's announcement that the US and Israel have agreed to try to find ways to get humanitarian aid into Gaza and set up ""safe zones"" for civilians.The initiative came after the secretary of state reported back to Washington the concerns of Arab leaders, says a senior state department official. The president instructed him to draw up a plan with the Israelis.Where Mr Biden will not push the Israelis is on their assessment of Hamas.US officials have adopted Israeli language that compares the Palestinian movement to the Islamic State group, saying it was an attack of ""sheer evil"" unrelated to legitimate frustrations about decades of Israeli occupation and the grinding misery of its 16-year blockade of Gaza.Khaled Elgindy, the director of Israeli-Palestinian Affairs at the Middle East Institute, says this ignores a chorus of warnings in the year leading up to the unprecedented incursion about an impending ""explosion"" in the Palestinian territories.He describes US policy as ""strategic neglect"".This video can not be playedWatch: Hundreds of displaced Gazans queue for bread""They've been committed to keeping the issue low down on the list of priorities,"" he says. ""I think that's one of the reasons we are where we are, is this neglect and allowing these wounds to fester. ""The status quo was comfortable for Israel and for the United States. But it was certainly not comfortable for Palestinians.""The Biden administration has focused its Middle East policy on integrating Israel into the region through a normalisation agreement with Saudi Arabia, which it argues is crucial for stability, while trying to pivot its attention more to China and Russia's war with Ukraine.Now, though, it fears a regional conflict that could force it to plunge back into the Middle East.The US is particularly concerned that Iran will capitalise on the situation through armed groups it supports, like Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement. Low-level clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon intensified at the weekend, as Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian conducted his own tour of allies in the region.That included a meeting with the Hamas representative in Qatar, where they discussed how to prevent Israel's expected further assault on Gaza, according to Iran's state news agency.Still, so far Iran has shown relative restraint.""They're playing the long game,"" says Mr Alterman, ""and I'm not sure that this is the moment when they want to go all in.""That could change depending on how Israel's ground operation in Gaza unfolds. The Pentagon has now sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean as a clear warning.Deterrence is a big part of the administration's ""rock solid"" show of support for Israel, says Mr Schenker, noting that the extraordinary damage Hamas inflicted on Israel made America's key partner in the Middle East look weak.""If we don't stand by Israel, we are further raising questions about our commitment to our regional allies,"" he says. ""Already for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, this US commitment to their security was in question.""There's no question the US will stand by Israel. The question is at what cost, and how that will affect its ability to shape the new strategic realities to come.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,16-Oct,"The world is still reeling from the unprecedent assault by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, and the subsequent retaliatory strikes by Israel and expected land invasion into the Gaza Strip.We have received hundreds of your questions about the conflict, its impact and where it may end, with many people asking if other countries will get involved in the war.Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have answered some of the most frequently asked questions below.Craig Johnson in Skelmersdale, UK asks: If Iran gets directly involved in the conflict, would that prompt the US and its allies to directly join the war? And could this lead to a third world war?Jeremy Bowen, our international editor, reporting from southern Israel, says:When asked about the possibility of intervention by Iran or its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, Joe Biden said: ""Don't.""The Americans just deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the eastern Mediterranean to send a very firm message to Iran to stay out.They're saying that if anyone intervenes, they will have American military might to reckon with, not just Israel's.One of the major fault lines in the Middle East runs between the US and its allies, and the Iranians and theirs.Both sides are aware of the risks. If it went from a cold to a hot war it would ignite a Middle East conflagration of global significance.Luciano Sisi in the Scottish Borders asks: What is Israel's overall objective with the anticipated ground war?Lyse Doucet, our chief international correspondent, in southern Israel says:In past wars, Israel vowed to ""hit Hamas hard"", to destroy its capacity to fire rockets into Israel - including its vast web of subterranean tunnels.This time is different. Israel is vowing ""to destroy Hamas"" - an organisation it says should be obliterated, like the Islamic State group.Israel has the military might to smash Hamas's infrastructure, crush its tunnels, and cripple its command and control networks.But it's not clear how much Israel knows about what awaits in Gaza. Hamas's military prowess, including an astonishingly granular understanding of Israeli security that enabled it to outsmart its formidable defences, has shocked Israelis.Hamas is likely to possess the same sophistication when it confronts what it knows will be a ferocious Israeli response.And unlike the Islamic State group, Hamas is also a political and social organisation embedded in Palestinian society.A military onslaught can destroy its metal and concrete but not the mettle of the people whose resolve to die for their cause will only harden.Andrew Parker in the UK asks: What was the goal of the initial Hamas attack?Frank Gardner, our security correspondent, tells us:The reason given at the time by Hamas's spokesman Mohammed Al-Deif was that ""enough is enough"".The attack, he said, was in response to what Hamas called constant provocations and humiliations suffered by Palestinians at the hands of Israelis in both Gaza and the West Bank.Analysts believe there may have been other, undeclared reasons.Before the attack, Israel and Saudi Arabia were well on the way to normalising ties.This was opposed by both Hamas and its backer, Iran. The Saudis have now suspended those talks.But there will have been more to it than that.Hamas's leadership will have noticed the sharp divisions in Israeli society caused by judicial reforms introduced by the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu.They aimed to deal Israel a painful blow - and in that they succeeded.Diana in the UK, who asks: Muslims speak of the family and brotherhood of Islam. How can Muslims in Egypt justify keeping their border with Gaza closed?Jeremy Bowen, our international editor, reporting from southern Israel says:Islam is a faith but it doesn't necessarily transcend the politics of national security.I'm certain millions of Egyptian Muslims want to alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza.But the Egyptian government, even at quiet times, does not allow routine access from Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Egypt has been the junior partner in earlier versions of Israel's siege of Gaza ever since Hamas took over there in 2007.Hamas has its roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, an organisation founded in Egypt a century ago. The Brotherhood wants to reshape states and society in line with Islamic teaching and belief.The Egyptian military opposes that desire. It overthrew an elected Muslim president in 2013.Egypt's current regime has relations with Hamas, and has in the past been the link between Hamas and Israel. But it does not want an influx of Palestinian refugees.The camps in Gaza still exist 75 years after they were established to house refugees - forced out by newly independent Israel - who have never been allowed home.Simon in the UK asks: The world issued an international arrest warrant against Putin. Why has there not been the same response against Hamas leadership? Was this not a war crime on a massive scale?Paul Adams, our world affairs correspondent answers:Israel did not consider itself at war with Hamas before 7 October, despite previous rounds of conflict stretching back many years.For Israel, this was an act of terrorism, not war.Benjamin Netanyahu's government is pursuing justice in its own way and has already killed at least two Hamas commanders it regards as responsible for the massacres.It will doubtless attempt to kill many more.Questions may arise about the organisation's political leadership - which lives in Qatar and Lebanon - who, some say, were unaware of the military wing's plans to attack inside Israel.This video can not be playedWatch: One week on - survivor Shye Weinstein recalls fleeing the Supernova festivalSadul Hoque from London asks: If everyone has agreed that Israel has been killing civilians and will kill a lot more in these new strikes, why are the UN and other countries not intervening?James Landale, our diplomatic correspondent gives this answer:The main reason why many countries are not urging Israel to stop its airstrikes is because they accept the country has been attacked by Hamas and has a right to defend itself.Where they are urging restraint is about how Israel defends itself.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said this morning: ""I've raised with the Israeli prime minister the need to minimise the impact on civilians as best we can.""The United Nations too has urged Israel to avoid civilian casualties.The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said a few days ago: ""International humanitarian law and human rights law must be respected and upheld; civilians must be protected and also never used as shields.""Israel insists its warplanes and artillery are striking Hamas targets in Gaza. But many civilians are indeed being killed and injured in those strikes.Palestinians say that is because the Israeli strikes are excessive and indiscriminate. Israel says it is because Hamas uses civilians as human shields.An anonymous reader asks: How is it possible that the Israeli military have enough intelligence and surveillance to know exactly where Hamas is stationed in Gaza, but it didn't know Hamas were going to attack Israel or see any warning signs of the attack?Yolande Knell, our Middle East correspondent, in Jerusalem, says:In the past, Israel's military has opened up its control centre for surveillance of Gaza to journalists, and it's clear that it has excellent real-time information about movements on the ground from drones and other cameras.It also has a vast network of informants.We saw in May's fighting with Islamic Jihad just how accurate Israel's information on the whereabouts of leading militants could be.In briefings, Israeli military officials accept there have been major intelligence and security failings when it comes to the unprecedented, deadly attack by Hamas.However, we can rely on the fact that it has an accurate, long list of Hamas targets that it will go after as soon as it gets boots on the ground.Further north from the Gaza Strip, tensions are rising between Lebanon and Israel. One reader wants to know: If Lebanon gets involved, how big a force is Hezbollah compared to Hamas?Hugo Bachega, reporting from southern Lebanon, says:Hezbollah - a Lebanese military, political, and social movement - has long been seen by Israel as a more formidable force than Hamas.The heavily armed Iranian-backed group has an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Most of this arsenal is made up of small, man-portable and unguided surface-to-surface artillery rockets.But it also includes anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel.This is much more sophisticated than what Hamas has at its disposal.Hezbollah's leader has claimed to have 100,000 fighters, although independent estimates vary between 20,000 and 50,000. Many are well trained and battle hardened, and have fought in the Syrian civil war.Hamas, by comparison, has an estimated 30,000 fighters, according to Israel.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,16-Oct,"This video can not be playedWatch: Rallies for Palestine, Israel create tense scene at Columbia UniversityA debate over the war between Israel and Hamas is raging on US college campuses. In a social media age that demands people pick a side on divisive issues, is there still space for young Americans to talk to each other?Hundreds of students gathered on the main quad at Columbia University in New York City last week to engage in duelling protests in support of Israel and the Palestinian people - and to condemn the loss of life.Pro-Israel protesters, most of whom were Jewish, draped themselves in white and blue Israeli flags. For much of the event, they remained silent, letting signs with photos of the victims of Hamas' deadly attack speak for them.Across the square, students who supported the Palestinians waved signs declaring ""Free Palestine"" and ""End the Occupation"". A female student from Gaza spoke of her mother, trapped by an Israeli blockade.Though the two sides stood just yards apart, the ideological distance between them seemed insurmountably wide, and only grew more pronounced as the evening progressed.One of the leaders of the pro-Palestinian demonstration read aloud an open letter published by two student groups at Columbia just a day after Hamas militants rampaged through a music festival and several Israeli towns, killing at least 1,400 people and taking about 150 hostages.The attack was a ""historic moment for the Palestinians of Gaza, who tore through the wall that has been suffocating them in one of the most densely populated areas on Earth"".""Despite the odds against them,"" the speaker continued to read, ""Palestinians launched a counter-offensive against their settler-colonial oppressor.""To these students, the attack on Israel was an important development in the decades-long fight for Palestinian autonomy. And Israel's response in the days since was another example of its indifference to the suffering of the Palestinian people.More than 2,700 Palestinians in Gaza have died during retaliatory Israeli air strikes, while just over two million people there are trapped by a blockade and cut off from power and clean water.Israeli officials have used extreme language, with Defence Minister Yoan Gallant referring to Hamas militants as ""human animals"". And the death toll will rise if Israel launches an expected ground offensive.Most of the activists at Thursday's rally would not speak to reporters. But Darializa Avila Chevilier, who graduated from Columbia in 2016 and had come to support the pro-Palestinian protesters, told the BBC: ""No-one wants violence. What we are saying is the violence will end when there's justice, and people are living with dignity.""The speakers at the rally condemned the loss of all civilian life and held a moment of silence. But they did not make specific mention of the Israeli victims of violence, or the atrocities carried out by Hamas fighters against civilians, including many women and children.The protest's organisers, Students for Justice in Palestine, told the BBC in a statement that they oppose any form of violence against innocent civilians and stand ""only for the preservation of life and justice"".They went on to question ""why an entire nationality—Palestinians—are being made to answer for the actions of [Hamas]"".Yet many of their Jewish classmates across the lawn heard something else in those speeches: a dismissal of murders perpetrated against their own religious and ethnic minority, which has also faced persecution.""If you are justifying the murder of innocent civilians, you do not understand human rights,"" one of their posters declared.Columbia University is not alone in reeling from this political divide.Student groups at Harvard University issued a statement which blamed Israel's policies for the massacre of its civilians, which prompted a backlash from powerful alumni.On other campuses across the country, students and schools have received an avalanche of criticism, accused by both sides of either justifying extremism or staying silent in the face of it.These arguments have played out over decades, but the unprecedented scale of the Hamas attack and Israel's military response means tensions and emotions are spiking.The current war is the culmination of a shift over the past two decades which has seen hardliners in power in Israel and Gaza, and the prospect for peace via a two-state solution diminish.""There is a growing gulf, but I think that gulf represents what's going on in Israel and Palestine,"" said Zachary Lockman, a professor at New York University who teaches a course on the history and politics of the conflict and has witnessed many campus debates over the years.Among students, he said, this translates into ""deepening polarisation, and very little common ground"". And at colleges and on social media, the debate is often framed as 'They're either with us or against us', he explained.Prof Lockman points out a few trends from the past decade or so that help explain the growing chasm on campus.First, the Palestinian cause has become more of a priority for left-wing groups in the US. Many activists see a link between the renewed focus in America on social justice and structural racism with Israel's blockade of Gaza and presence in the West Bank.In the US, critics of the Israeli government are more likely to see the state of Israel - and especially the expansion of Israeli settlements which most of the international community deems illegal - through the lens of colonialism.Simultaneously, Americans' attitudes towards Israel have shifted along generational lines. Younger people are far more likely to have an unfavourable view of Israel than a favourable one, a July 2022 Pew Research Center poll found.And a partisan divide has opened up as well. For the first time, Democrats are now more likely likely to feel more sympathy for the Palestinian people, according to Gallup polling, while Republicans are more likely to sympathise with Israel.Students who back the Palestinian cause argue that while support for their stance may have grown, they believe that pro-Israel sentiment remains strong among America's political, media and academic establishment.At Thursday's protest, Students for Justice in Palestine condemned Columbia University leadership for not taking a firmer stand in support of the Palestinian people. ""I lied to [my mother],"" a young woman from Gaza told the crowd, ""telling her I was safe at university.""Back across the quad, the young Jews who attended the rally in support of Israel said they often found themselves frustrated and alienated by the tone of campus debates.""Even in this liberal university, people cannot respect one another,"" said Lihi Tal, 24, who is studying at Columbia after completing her military service in Israel. ""We're feeling lonely here in the university. There are some people who supports us, but I'm afraid to say that I'm a Jew.""Other students held strongly partisan stances on the conflict. One Israeli student, Daniel Katz, wandered over to listen to the opposing protest, but found himself unpersuaded. He solely blamed Palestinians for the situation in Gaza before this latest conflict erupted, which human rights groups have called inhumane due to Israel's 16-year blockade.""They chose [Hamas] to lead, and they betray their own people,"" he said, referring to the 2006 election that brought the militant group to power and is the last election held there.The signs held by pro-Israel students on Thursday featured many victims of Hamas' attack, but did not display the casualties in Gaza that have mounted as Israel retaliates.Like their classmates across the lawn, these students also condemned suffering of civilians on both sides, but remained focused on the Israeli and international victims of the terror attack.A few felt that more nuanced views of the war were being drowned out, and worried that the rhetorical battle lines being drawn would not help students gain a better understanding of the conflict - or each other.""I think it's very unfortunate, it really saddens me that we're on opposite sides,"" said Stephanie, a 20-year-old Jewish student from Brooklyn who asked the BBC not to reveal her last name.""There's not there's not enough dialogue between these two [groups]. Everything's separate.""Stephanie had joined the pro-Israel side, but worried that pro-Palestinian classmates were ignoring or misunderstanding the range of Jewish opinion on Israel and its current right government.""People don't recognise that this group…support Jews and support Israel as a safe haven for them,"" Stephanie said. ""But also, there's diversity of opinion, and that people also support Palestinian life and Palestinian safety.""Before Thursday's protests, a classmate had approached Stephanie to discuss organising an event where students from opposing sides could talk through the conflict.""I do believe there is a chance for that to happen, for people to come together in that way,"" Stephanie said. ""I think right now, it's difficult.""© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,16-Oct,"Israel's military is evacuating 28 communities near the northern border with Lebanon because of escalating hostilities with Hezbollah militants.An Israeli civilian and a soldier were killed on Sunday, when anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon hit one of the villages and a military post.The military said it struck Hezbollah military sites in response.It also accused the group's backer, Iran, of ordering attacks in an effort to distract Israel from the Gaza war.Iran meanwhile warned Israel of the risk of a regional conflict if it continued attacking the Palestinian territory in retaliation for the deadly assault by the militant group Hamas earlier this month.Hezbollah is Lebanon's most powerful military force and has long-range rockets at its disposal that could strike deep into Israeli territory. It fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006.During a visit to a community co-ordination centre in the northern town of Shlomi on Monday, Israeli government minister Benny Gantz was asked by the BBC whether he thought there would be another war with Hezbollah.""I hope for them not, but we do all the preparations,"" he replied.The IDF announced on Monday morning that it was implementing an emergency plan to evacuate all civilians living up to 2km (1.2 miles) from the Lebanese border and put them up in state-funded guest houses.A spokesman said the evacuation was a precaution to ""reduce harm to civilians and enable the IDF freedom of action if it is required"".However, several border villages are already three-quarters empty or more.Residents told the BBC that families had not waited for the official order, packed up their things and taken their children south to safety.In many cases, the only people left in the villages now are soldiers and members of local security teams who stayed behind to help them.The communities are so close to the border that you can see the fortified fence built by Israel along it. In some of them, you can also see the Hezbollah observation posts on the other side.At one point on Sunday, there was intense fighting in several different locations along the frontier, as the IDF and Hezbollah exchanged fire.Israel reported its first civilian death from a Hezbollah strike in the current violence. A man in his 40s was killed in an anti-tank missile attack on the border village of Shtula.Later, an Israeli soldier, Lt Amitai Granot, was killed in another missile attack on a military post, Israeli media reported.In a separate exchange, a rocket hit the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, in the city of Naqoura. No-one was injured.The IDF said it carried out strikes on Sunday and overnight that targeted Hezbollah military infrastructure.It also reported that nine rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory, five of which were intercepted, and that it struck the launch sites in response.Last Monday, three Israeli soldiers were killed in a confrontation with militants from Palestinian Islamic Jihad who had crossed over the border from Lebanon. Later that day, at least three Hezbollah militants were killed as the IDF attacked sites in Lebanon in response to mortar fire.And on Friday, a Reuters news agency cameraman, Issam Abdallah, was killed by shellfire while reporting near the Lebanese village of Alma al-Shaab. The IDF said it was investigating Lebanon's claim that Israeli troops fired the shell.The IDF has deployed tens of thousands of additional soldiers along the border in the past week, but Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters on Sunday that it had ""no interest in a war in the north"".""If Hezbollah chooses the path of war, it will pay a very heavy price. Very heavy. But if it restrains itself, we will respect that and keep the situation as it is,"" he added.Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian meanwhile said his country had conveyed a message to Israel through its allies that ""if they do not cease their atrocities in Gaza, Iran cannot simply remain an observer"".He also warned that if the ""scope of the war"" expanded the United States would suffer ""significant damages"".The US said it was sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea on Sunday as part of ""deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas's attack"".© 2023 BBC.

BBC,18-Oct,"For an American president, turning up in a warzone is an extraordinary move.Joe Biden's trip to the Middle East on Wednesday was always going to be a high-stakes gamble.But he is now flying into an even more volatile situation, after the bombing of a hospital in Gaza that is thought to have killed hundreds of Palestinians.Hamas has blamed an Israeli air strike, but Israel said the blast at Al Ahli hospital was caused by rockets fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Mr Biden had planned to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and Arab leaders in Jordan.But just before Air Force One took off from Joint Base Andrews, the summit in Amman was suddenly cancelled.President Biden will have wanted to look like an honest broker dealing with both sides in the Middle East.He now faces the embarrassment of being told by the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority that they have no confidence in his ability to end the violence, which they say is in breach of international law.There is no doubt whose side President Biden is on when it comes to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.The president described the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October - which left more than 1,400 Israelis dead - as ""sheer evil"", and said the country had a right and a duty to defend itself.His hastily organised visit is designed to further demonstrate America's firm solidarity with the Jewish state.But he is having to balance his support for Israel's aim of destroying Hamas with his deep concerns about the civilian and humanitarian cost.And while he has publicly warned of the need to operate by the ""rules of war"", the message he delivers behind closed doors could be more stern.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US and Israel stood for the rule of law, ""unlike Hamas"".""This is a foundational element of the discussions we've had with the Israelis forever, and we will continue doing that,"" he said.The US wants Israel to allow aid into Gaza, and for it to allow safe passage for trapped Americans in Gaza.After nearly eight hours of talks with Mr Netanyahu on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had made good progress towards these goals, yet still nothing has been agreed.President Biden is also crucially aware that global public sentiment could quickly change, and support for Israel might evaporate when overwhelmed by images of Palestinian casualties and suffering.This video can not be playedWatch: Mother of hostage: 'What is it that Hamas wants?'There is also a very real fear that the more brutal the assault on Gaza, the greater the chance that it could trigger a wider conflict in the region with other countries getting involved.Then there are inevitable security concerns.The apparatus that accompanies the president abroad is formidable at the best of times, and a short-notice trip to a conflict zone will be a considerable challenge.Mr Blinken and his entourage were forced to seek shelter in a bunker as air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv on Monday - that would be a difficult look for a president.This could be one situation in which Mr Biden's age becomes an advantage not a problem.He has been visiting Israel for 50 years, and he has known Mr Netanyahu for 40 years, describing theirs as a ""frank relationship"".That will allow for a more robust exchange of views than those that can be shared between leaders who don't have that kind of personal history.President Biden has clear ideas about what he believes should and should not happen next.This video can not be playedWatch: Woman sees hostage sister in social media videoHe thinks it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza.He has said there needs to be a Palestinian Authority and a path to a Palestinian state, even though there has been no progress towards Palestinian statehood for many years.He will surely want to put the maximum pressure he can on Israel to operate more carefully in Gaza, and to end the conflict as quickly as possible.The US has consistently been Israel's most loyal and committed ally.Regardless of who is in the White House, there has always been broad support for the Jewish state and its right to exist in safety and security.President Biden has for decades been one of the politicians most outspoken in his backing for Israel, saying in 1986 that ""were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect our interests in the region"".Now it is time for the US president to use all the influence and leverage he has at his disposal to try to limit the bloodshed and loss of life, and prevent an all-out war across the Middle East.All while events on the ground are making it harder than ever.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,17-Oct,"MI5 is monitoring for increased risks to the UK as the Israel-Gaza war continues, its head has told the BBC.""One of the things that concerns me most right now, is to understand quite what the shape of the UK impact will be,"" Ken McCallum said in an interview.He also warned there was a risk that events in the Middle East could radicalise people towards violence.He was speaking at an unprecedented public appearance of security chiefs of the Five Eyes alliance in California.The heads of US, UK, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand security agencies were appearing together for the first time to warn of technological innovation being stolen by China.In an interview with the BBC, Mr McCallum said ""the scale and monstrous nature"" of the Hamas attack on Israel had come as a ""shock"".Discussing the possibility of the Israel-Gaza conflict radicalising people in the UK towards violence, he said: ""That is certainly a risk.""""It has always been the case that lots of would-be-terrorists in the UK draw inspiration through their distorted understanding of what is happening in other countries.""He said he could not comment on specific intelligence relating to any threats the Security Service is currently seeing.But he said that MI5 was already watching a ""pretty large cohort"" of people with extremist mindsets and that one of the most challenging parts of its work was trying to detect when these people, often acting alone, suddenly moved towards violence in new or unpredictable ways.In recent years, MI5 has seen a shift toward lone-actors inspired by events but not formally part of any organisation or group. They can be harder to spot and to work out when they are about to act, Mr McCallum said.US officials say they have already seen a rise in reported threats in the wake of events in the Middle East.""We cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or other foreign terrorist organisations could exploit the conflict to call on their supporters to conduct attacks on our own soil,"" FBI Director Chris Wray, told reporters.""We are also particularly alert to the potential these events have to inspire violence against Jewish Americans or Muslim Americans, institutions and houses of worship.""A six-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death in Illinois on Saturday in what has been described as a hate crime.Stanford University in California was chosen as the venue for this unprecedented first public meeting of the Five Eyes because it lies in the heart of Silicon Valley and the security chiefs are issuing a public warning about China stealing innovation.But in private meetings together, the Middle East will be high on the agenda.""As you'd expect, we will also use our time together to discuss a range of other issues in private, including what Hamas's attack means both in the region and in our homelands,"" Mr McCallum said.The MI5 head told the BBC that one of the most difficult aspects of the role was to balance resources against different types of threats which were equally concerning.""How do you balance the ability to track a teenage would-be terrorist consuming extreme right-wing and hateful material in his bedroom and potentially considering buying a bladed weapon with the longer term risks posed by fast or precious cutting edge research from one of our universities? They both matter to our national security.""© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,17-Oct,"Videos have emerged from the 7 October attacks by Hamas on civilians in southern Israel, showing some of those targeted being held in their homes and live-streamed by the attackers themselves.More than a week on from the attacks, relatives of the victims desperate for information are using these videos to try to piece together what happened to them, and some have expressed frustration with the Israeli authorities' lack of progress in finding their loved ones.One of those is Nir Darwish, a UK-based relative of a family of five who disappeared from the Nahal Oz kibbutz.The family - Noam Elyakim, his partner Dikla Arava, her 17-year-old son Tomer, and Noam's two daughters Daphna, 15, and Ella, 8 - are seen apparently being held in their home by the attackers. The girls, who live with their mother, were thought to be visiting their father to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the kibbutz.But on Monday this week, the extended family got news from the authorities that Dikla and Tomer had been killed and that their bodies had been found outside the kibbutz.Mr Darwish says that several photos posted by Hamas show Ella and Daphna in captivity. The BBC has been unable to independently verify this.On Tuesday, Mr Darwish told the BBC that it had been confirmed that Noam - who is seen in the live-streamed video with a leg wound - was dead. The last photo of him appears to show him being led down a dusty road by the attackers.Nir, a cousin of the Elyakims, believes the girls are in Gaza, and that Hamas is keeping them in a tunnel somewhere.""They are sitting [in the photos] on a mattress and there is no natural light, so that's 100% in Gaza,"" he tells the BBC.He adds that some time passed between the live stream and the photos being posted, which would have given the attackers time to get back to Gaza.Mr Darwish said he and other family members found the video of the girls heart-breaking. He was very pessimistic about what would happen to them.""Nobody wants to go through this and especially when it's two little girls and especially when you know what's going to happen to them, because they're not going to give them water and food and treat them nice,"" he says.He said the planned Israeli ground operation was a ""big mistake"" and believes the military will never find the hostages.The Israeli military says it is using ""all intelligence and operational measures"" for the return of the captives, whose presence at unknown locations in Gaza will greatly complicate any operation.The girls' mother Maayan, however, is trying to stay upbeat. She spoke to the BBC from her home in Israel.""Stay strong, look out for one another. Look out for daddy - daddy will look after you, and take care of you,"" she says in a message to her daughters. ""We are doing everything to bring you back. We are very strong here. We will bring you back.""She described the girls, saying one loved to sing, the other to dance, and that they were inseparable.The BBC has been unable to access the full half-hour of the live stream of militants inside Noam and Dikla's house, but has seen extracts of it.Filmed on Dikla's phone, it appears to show the family sitting on a bench in their home. As it is streamed, shocked messages from friends and family can be seen on her screen.Noam is injured, and losing a lot of blood from what looks like a serious leg wound. At one point, he limps away, escorted by one of the militants after they ask him for his ID card. His partner and daughters are clearly frightened.Nir Darwish talks through with the BBC another part of the video, in which the attackers take Tomer out of the house to knock on doors of neighbours, to persuade them that the danger has passed and that they can come out.He believes that this is to ""make life easier for the terrorists... to capture them, kill them or whatever it is"".No-one does come out of the house shown, but Nir says that later the attackers threw flaming tyres into the house to burn it down.It is not clear if anyone died in this incident, but it is possible that these types of tactics were used elsewhere and did contribute to the loss of life.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,15-Oct,"Israel's expected assault on Gaza continues to dominate the papers.The Sunday Times has spoken to Israeli reservists waiting for orders, among whom, it says, there's no thirst for revenge - they simply answered a call of duty. The Observer says people living in Gaza are already running out of food, water, fuel and medical supplies - and now face a terrifying escalation of bloodshed and misery.""Escape to hell"" is the Sunday Mirror's headline. The front page features an image of a man carrying an injured child following a bombing raid on the city of Khan Yunis in the south of the territory, to where civilians in the north have been told to move.In an editorial, the Sunday Telegraph says politicians across the democratic world made a devastating error when they believed that Hamas could be tamed, even though it had never made a secret of its dedication to the destruction of Israel. The paper says Hamas is a threat that must be destroyed, but that the conflict will also be a disaster for the Gazans, because they live in a prison of Hamas' making.Retired US general David Petraeus - who led allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan - tells the Sunday Times that Israeli troops entering Gaza face the most difficult urban warfare task since World War Two. He says Hamas has had months to prepare and that the Israelis should expect fiendishly difficult ambushes and rooms rigged to blow up.Writing in the Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden says Britain's support for Israel ""must not dissipate when the reality of fighting an enemy that hides in tunnels and amongst civilian homes, schools, and hospitals takes shape"".A Sunday Times editorial says it's incumbent on Israel's allies to combine unconditional support with an urging of restraint. The paper says Hamas and its shadowy backers have hoped for precisely what seems to be looming: an explosion of fighting in Gaza that spirals into a broader conflagration, bringing in the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and even Iran.The front page of the Mail on Sunday features a picture of two women at Saturday's pro-Palestine march in London with pictures of paragliders taped to their jackets. Some of the Hamas militants who attacked a music festival in Israel last weekend, killing more than 260 people, entered the site by paraglider. The paper says that, ""following a week of abject horror, there could scarcely be a more obscene insult"" and asks: ""Why didn't the police stop them?""The Sun on Sunday says a pro-Palestinian group is planning to use sledgehammers to attack buildings in the UK linked to Israel. The paper says it uncovered the plot when reporters penetrated a secret Zoom meeting by the group.Also writing in the Telegraph, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk argues that some low-level offenders should be ordered to clean neighbourhoods, scrub graffiti off walls, and plant forests, rather than given prison sentences. Mr Chalk also says he'll end early release for violent and sexual offenders and make sure rapists spend the entirety of their sentence in prison.And finally, most papers feature pictures of Princes William and George looking disappointed following Wales's defeat by Argentina in the quarter finals of the Rugby World Cup in France. The Mail says it marks the first time the younger royal has travelled overseas for a sporting fixture and that, by attending a Wales match instead of an England one, he ""appears to have made his loyalties clear"".© 2023 BBC.

BBC,17-Oct,"This video can not be playedWatch: Blinken explains why Biden is visiting IsraelPresident Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday in a show of support as the US works to prevent the war with Hamas from spreading across the region.The trip was announced by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said Mr Biden would visit at ""a critical moment for Israel, for the region and the world"".Mr Blinken, who spoke in Tel Aviv on Monday, said the president would stress ""ironclad"" commitment to Israel.Mr Biden is also expected to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The decision to go ahead with the landmark visit followed more than seven hours of negotiations between the president, Mr Blinken and Mr Netanyahu's war cabinet.When announcing the plans, Mr Blinken said the president would make clear that ""Israel has the right and the duty to defend its people from Hamas and other terrorists and prevent future attacks"".He also said Mr Biden would receive a briefing on Israel's war aims and strategy, and hear ""how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow [to] civilians in Gaza"".The trip comes as concern over the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip grows. More than a million people have been displaced inside Gaza, which is one of the world's most densely populated territories, and food, water and fuel are in short supply.Washington estimates that 500 to 600 Americans remain trapped there.""It is critical that aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible,"" Mr Blinken said, adding that the US and Israel had agreed to ""develop a plan"" to get aid to civilians there.He also said Mr Biden would work to try to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas, which the US and other Western governments have designated a terrorist organisation.Israel has said at least 199 people are believed to have been taken hostage after the group launched its unprecedented attack from Gaza on 7 October.At least 1,400 people were killed when gunmen breached the border and infiltrated Israeli communities.More than 2,700 people have been killed in retaliatory air strikes against Gaza by the Israeli military. Israel has also massed troops along the border ahead of an expected ground offensive.That offensive, however, is likely to be delayed until after Mr Biden's departure from Israel although officials in the country have not commented on this.Iran earlier warned that Israel would not be allowed to act in Gaza without consequences. Its foreign minister said it could take ""pre-emptive action"" against Israel in the coming hours.It is thought that would involve the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon, which has been exchanging fire with Israel in recent days.This video can not be playedWatch: Missiles soar above Tel Aviv and people run for shelterThe comment highlighted concern over the risk of a broader regional conflict breaking out, and the US and other Western countries have warned Iran against any escalation.After visiting Israel, Mr Biden will travel to Amman in Jordan where he will meet King Abdullah, Egypt's President Al-Sisi and the President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas.Those talks will largely focus on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, White House officials said.Mr Blinken, meanwhile, has visited a number of countries in the Middle East since the Hamas attack including Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,4 hours ago,"In the last few days I have been in southern Israel close to the border with Gaza, deep in the West Bank with hard-line Jewish settlers, and seen the funeral of two young Palestinian men killed by the Israeli army in a raid on a refugee camp.I've spoken to a former Israeli leader in his office in a Tel Aviv high rise, and a senior Palestinian official in his office in a villa in Ramallah. I have heard an Israeli father at a vigil in Tel Aviv describe how his daughter's birthday cake was still in the fridge when his wife and three young children were taken by Hamas gunmen as hostages.What I have not been able to do is enter Gaza. Only small convoys of aid, and a handful of Israeli combat troops on raids and reconnaissance, have been able to do that.More Palestinians and Israelis have been killed in the last two and a half weeks or so than in the entire second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, that lasted from 2000 until it petered out around the end of 2004.Among the different people I've met, Palestinians and Israelis as well as foreigners, I have had a single clear impression. A sense that the grim old routines that have settled on this long conflict since the end of the last intifada have been swept away by the enormity of events since 7 October, and replaced with a fear that what comes next will be even worse.The occupied Palestinian territories consist of Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israel captured them, along with the Golan Heights which it took from Syria, in the 1967 Middle East war.It was the most sweeping and rapid victory in Israel's history, achieved in only six days. Coming 19 years after Israel's independence war of 1948, which Palestinians call the catastrophe, or al-Nakba, the 1967 war created the cockpit in which the conflict as it stands today is fought.Like many others who follow the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians I have felt for the last few years that a major explosion was coming.On 14 May 2018, I thought that might have started, during the terrible violence that accompanied President Donald Trump's decision to move the embassy of the United States from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.President Trump rejected the international convention that Jerusalem's status was unresolved, as both Israel and the Palestinians claim it as a capital. He sided with Israel. Most of Israel's other allies, including the United Kingdom, still have their embassies in Tel Aviv.As the president's daughter Ivanka Trump opened the embassy, broadcasters split their screens to show terrible violence on the border wire between Israel and Gaza.Israeli soldiers shot to kill as thousands of Palestinians demonstrated near the fence in what was called ""the great march of return"" by Hamas. Some of them tried to pull the fence down. Some 59 Palestinians were shot dead and thousands more wounded. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, supported by the US, said any country would repel an attack on its border.The next day was much calmer.  A few weeks later the routines of the conflict were re-established. Benjamin Netanyahu, and his allies in the Trump administration, were able to congratulate themselves that the Palestinians had been contained.Perhaps that was the moment that Hamas started planning a much more devastating way to breach the border and attack Israel, which culminated in the 7 October attacks.Benjamin Netanyahu's decision - supported by the Americans - to allow the conflict to fester, in the mistaken belief that Israel could keep a lid on it while attending to more important matters, turned out to be a strategic error of monumental proportions.I walked up the stone staircase to the office of Sabri Saidam in Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank. He was educated at Imperial College, London, is an adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas and is a senior member of Fatah, the faction once led by Yasser Arafat that dominates the Palestine Liberation Organisation.Mr Abbas heads the Palestinian Authority, which was created in the Oslo peace process of the 1990s as a government in the making for an independent state. Now it is at best a job creation scheme with municipal functions, at worst a symbol of inefficiency and corruption. Abbas has not put himself up for re-election since 2006.Sabri Saidam said they had warned the Americans over Benjamin Netanyahu's belief that he could manage the Palestinians while trying, with American help, to normalise relations with the rich Gulf Arab oil monarchies.""A reaction was coming. It was in the pipeline. Nobody knew what was the scale and the shape of it. But we have told the Americans many times in meetings that the Palestinians would react and don't leave matters hanging in the balance. You have to intervene. You have to be serious about the peace process.""He rejected the suggestion that Hamas was using people as human shields and now, he said, Israel is engaged in ""genocide"".The peace process is shorthand for the years of ultimately failed negotiations that were supposed to end the conflict by creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel. That is the ""two-state solution"" that President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, President Emmanuel Macron and other dignitaries who have been here in the last few weeks have said once again is the only realistic solution.The trouble with that is that there is no peace process - the Americans last tried, and failed, to revive it ten years ago under President Barack Obama - and the two-state solution has become an empty slogan.I went to see the former Prime Minister Ehud Barak in his glass-walled office in a tower in Tel Aviv. In 1973, as a young special forces commander, he planned and led an audacious raid on Lebanon, which they called Operation Spring of Youth. Barak was disguised as a woman, with make-up and a blonde wig, as he led an assassination team that slipped into Beirut to devastating effect.Mr Barak went on to command the Israeli military and was prime minister from 1999-2001 and later served as defence minister under Benjamin Netanyahu, who in turn had been a junior officer in his special forces unit, the Israeli equivalent of Britain's SAS.Since then, Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu have become political enemies. Barak has blamed Netanyahu for mistakes that left Israel vulnerable to Hamas. He believes the prime minister's long years in office will end once the army deals with Hamas.""Winning the war,"" Mr Barak told me, ""will take time and then the torrent of sweat and decent blood is not going to be something simple… when it's over or half over or there is a situation of whatever kind it would be a volcano of rage, it will erupt, I believe. To remove this government from power.""One reason for Mr Netanyahu's reluctance, up to now anyway, to send ground troops into Gaza is the presence of more than 200 hostages, mostly Israeli civilians. Hamas took them to put pressure on Israel and is succeeding.Releasing four hostages and talking about freeing many more has become an effective tactic in the psychological war between the two sides. Voices in Israel are getting louder, demanding a halt to any invasion plans until the hostages are free.Ehud Barak, who believes Israel has to send troops into Gaza to eliminate Hamas, said that hard choices lie ahead for Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet.""If there is no other way, we will have to do it, because the alternative is to provide those barbarians and terrorists who made crimes against humanity [with] impunity due to the fact that they massacred, slaughtered probably 1,500 people…  A very painful and tough decision might have to be made.""I drove through the West Bank over two days this week, and saw an area that was extremely tense, with Israel in tight control. Thousands of soldiers in combat gear have sealed off Palestinian villages, set up roadblocks and are protecting Jewish settlements, which are regarded as illegal under international law although Israel disputes this.In an isolated settler outpost on a desolate hilltop outside Hebron, hard line Jewish nationalists carrying weapons told me they were waiting for the chance to use them against Palestinians. Their leader Meir Simcha, who walked round the outpost armed with a large machete in a leather scabbard, said that unlike other Israelis they had not been surprised by the Hamas assault on 7 October. It was a shame, he said, that so many Jews had to die to show mainstream Israel something he believed was self-evident.""In a war you have a gun and a trigger,"" Simcha said. ""And for those who don't understand yet, we are at war. A war where the other side shows no mercy and we need to do the same. There's no choice.""Further north in the West Bank, the atmosphere in Jalazone refugee camp, just outside Ramallah, was sombre, fearful and angry, as two young men killed in an Israeli army arrest operation were buried. Mustapha al-Ayan - cousin of Mahmoud Seif, one of the dead men who was shot as he threw stones at the Israelis - said the army had not come to arrest suspects but to punish them for what Hamas did on 7 October.The grave was being filled behind him as he told me: ""They are coming to the West Bank to take revenge, because the resistance groups in Gaza have hurt them. So now they are attacking the people in the West Bank. God give mercy to all the martyrs in Gaza and the West Bank.""One fear often expressed by Palestinians is that Israel, in its rage, is using the crisis to try to inflict another Nakba, or catastrophe, on the scale of 1948. The evidence they cite is the way that more than a million Gazans have been forced to flee to the south of the Strip, and the threats made by some Israeli politicians to make Gaza smaller by taking tranches of land to use as buffer zones.In Ramallah, Sabri Saidam, the Fatah official, talked about a map that Mr Netanyahu produced at the United Nations in September, showing an Israel that included the West Bank and Gaza.""Everybody has in mind that the very map that Netanyahu carried before the nations at the General Assembly of the UN, in which there was no West Bank and Gaza. So the feel and general mood is actually entertaining the thought that Netanyahu is going after the deportation, the displacement of Palestinians leading up to the annexation of Gaza.""The ghosts of the past shape the mood on both sides. For Israel it is the Holocaust of European Jews at the hands of Nazi Germany. The massacres on 7 October have been called the worst day for the Jews since the Holocaust. The word ""selection"", that was used to describe the way Jews arriving at death camps were either sent straight to the gas chambers or spared to be worked to death, has been applied to suggestions that deals might be done that release foreign hostages before Israelis.Palestinians don't share much with Israelis, especially not now, except the shadow of the past and a dread of harder times ahead.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,13-Oct,"A country on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, Israel is the only state in the world with a majority Jewish population.It has been locked in conflict with the Palestinians and its Arab neighbours over ownership of land considered holy by many Jews, Christians and Muslims since its creation in 1948.The division of the former British Mandate of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel in the years after the end of World War Two was the culmination of the Zionist movement, whose aim was a homeland for Jews hitherto scattered all over the world.Security concerns over the conflict with the Palestinians are a constant factor in a political environment marked by volatile coalition governments. Israel faces hostility from much of the Arab region, and the US provides crucial diplomatic and military support. Some of the borders remain in dispute.President: Isaac HerzogThe presidency is a largely ceremonial post and notionally above party politics, but individual presidents have used a combination of their personal prestige and the authority of their office to make interventions in national debates.Parliament elected Isaac Herzog to the post in 2021. He is the son of a former president, and led the centre-left Labour Party in 2013-2017. He also served in various government posts between 2005 and 2011.Prime Minister: Benjamin NetanyahuBenjamin Netanyahu, who is chairman of the right-wing Likud party, has been Israel's prime minister since December 2022, leading a government seen as  the most right-wing in Israel's history. He was previously prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and again from 2009 to 2021, making him the longest-serving prime minister in Israel's history.Mr Netanyahu's unrivalled success owes much to the image he has cultivated as the person who can best keep Israel safe from hostile forces in the Middle East.He has taken a tough line towards the Palestinians, putting security concerns at the top of any talk of peace, and long warned of existential danger to Israel from Iran.But hanging over his political achievements is the cloud of a criminal trial for alleged bribery, fraud and breach of trust - charges he fiercely denies.Israel's press and broadcasters are many and varied, reflecting differences in language, political viewpoint and religious outlook.TV is the leading medium and commercial networks top the ratings. Public broadcasting saw a major change in 2017, when the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) ended more than 50 years of operations and was replaced by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC).After the Nazi Holocaust, pressure grew for the international recognition of a Jewish state, and in 1948 Israel declared its independence following a UN vote to partition Palestine.Much of the history of the area since that time has been one of conflict between Israel on one side and Palestinians and Israel's Arab neighbours, on the other.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were displaced in the fighting in 1948, during which Israel's Arab neighbours came to the aid of the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine. The fighting ended in a series of uneasy armistices.Israel has developed from an agrarian state run along collectivist lines into a hi-tech economy in the past 70 years. It has absorbed Jewish immigrants from Europe, the rest of the Middle East, North America and, most recently, the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia along the way.Its political life has nonetheless been dominated by the conflict with its Arab neighbours, including full-scale regional wars in 1948, 1967 and 1973, and many smaller-scale conflicts including the 1956 invasion of Egypt and the Lebanon wars of 1982 and 2006.Relations with the Palestinians have been a major factor in foreign and security policy. The Palestinians in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem have lived under Israeli occupation since 1967.The settlements that Israel has built in the West Bank are home to 500,000 people and are deemed to be illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.Israel evacuated its settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and withdrew its forces, ending almost four decades of military presence inside Gaza. Israel continues to control Gaza's air space and coastal approaches, on the basis of which the international community considers Gaza still to be occupied territory.After the militant Islamic group Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza in June 2007, Israel intensified its economic blockade of the Strip, along with Egypt, with multiple offensives against militants in Gaza in order to halt cross-border rocket attacks.In 1979 Egypt and Israel signed a peace agreement, but it wasn't until the early 1990s, after years of an uprising known as the intifada, that a peace process began with the Palestinians. Despite the handover of Gaza and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian control, a final agreement has yet to be reached.The main stumbling blocks include the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, Jewish settlements, and attacks by Palestinian armed groups.In 2020, increasing regional cooperation between Israel and some Arab League countries led to Israel and the UAE, together with fellow Gulf state Bahrain, signing the US-brokered Abraham Accords on normalising relations.Beginning in the 2010s, the regional security situation has shifted away from the previous Arab-Israeli conflict towards a proxy conflict between Iran and Israel, alongside direct confrontation Iran during Syria's civil war.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,15-Oct,"Social media has been awash with false claims, conspiracy theories and hateful content surrounding what's happening in Israel and Gaza - and questions over whether inauthentic accounts are being used to manipulate the conversation.As violence unfolds on the ground, I've been looking into who is behind this.When I opened up my TikTok For You Page earlier this week, I was met with a video showing a young Israeli woman being taken hostage by Hamas fighters on 7 October. The footage was shocking.When I scrolled through the comments, the reaction was not what I expected.While some were distressed by the post, other users falsely suggested this footage was not what it seemed.They said the woman in it is ""not a civilian"" but a soldier, or that the clips had been staged to frame Hamas.Some claimed there's no evidence the group have acted violently towards hostages.The clip, which has been verified by the BBC, shows a young woman covered in blood being pushed into a car by armed men. It was filmed on the outskirts of Gaza City in Sheijia.I scrolled through several more videos and posts about hostages on other social media sites and spotted similar comments.Israeli people are subject to compulsory national service - but evidence suggests many of those taken hostage by Hamas are civilians, like the people featured in these videos. The hostages include festival-goers and children.Disinformation is not limited to accounts seeking to undermine violence against hostages, either. Profiles supporting the actions of the Israeli government have also shared misleading and hateful content.One account I came across this weekend shared a video falsely suggesting Palestinian people were faking their injuries in Gaza. The footage was actually from a 2017 report about a makeup artist working on Palestinian films and with charities.All of these claims were not just shocking to me - they affect the wider understanding of what's happening.Successful attempts to distort and confuse the online conversation make it a lot harder to get to the truth of what's unfolding on the ground if you're relying on social media for updates.That can have serious implications for the international community when it comes to investigating allegations of war crimes, providing aid and figuring out what's happening where.Sometimes, the source of these misleading posts is easier to identify.Take, for example, celebrities, like popstar Justin Bieber, who inadvertently shared a post on Instagram asking people to ""pray for Israel' - but used images showing the destruction of Gaza by Israeli forces.Several accounts on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a track record of pushing conspiracy theories about crises have amplified misleading posts in what seems to be a bid to either downplay or exaggerate what's happening on the ground.That includes sharing old videos from different wars and footage from video games, which the accounts claim is from the current situation in Israel and Gaza.Some very active accounts on X sharing pro-Israel content and anti-Muslim posts appear to be based in India and express support for the country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.I want to try to get to the bottom of the profiles whose identities and locations are less obvious.Several of the accounts suggesting that hostages were soldiers rather than civilians seem to belong to real, younger people. They have otherwise shared funny memes or football clips to their profiles.Some have posted pictures with slogans like ""Free Palestine"". When I message them they tell me they are based in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.For some profiles, whether they're real people is less obvious.A handful have posted about an eclectic mix of political topics; in support of Russian President Putin and the war in Ukraine, as well as about former US President Donald Trump. Several of these accounts are newly set up or have recently become active.In the past, both the Israeli government and Hamas militants have faced accusations of trying to distort online narratives with ""bot"" networks - inauthentic accounts used to repeatedly push divisive or misleading ideas.According to Cyabra, a company based in Israel that analyses social media, one in five accounts taking part in conversations about the attacks committed by Hamas since 7 October are fake.""Fake"" in this context can mean they are automatically operated - but others could also be run by real people posing under false identities.The company says they've found approximately 40,000 fake accounts, including on X and TikTok.It says some of these profiles have been spreading misleading claims in support of Hamas and suggesting - for example - that militants were compassionate to hostages in situations where evidence suggests otherwise. That does not rule out the existence of inauthentic pro-Israel accounts, too.There are clues we can use to identify an account as inauthentic. For example, if a profile is newly set up and is suddenly sharing a large amount of divisive, misleading and at times conflicting content.Ultimately, though, determining whether a profile is actually fake and who exactly is behind it is a very difficult task. It requires information from the social media companies that journalists don't often have access to.Social media sites have been widely criticised over the spread of disinformation this week. The EU is investigating X over the possible spread of terrorist and violent content, and hate speech.Former Twitter (X) employees have previously told me how the company is no longer able to protect against state-co-ordinated disinformation following layoffs under new owner Elon Musk.Ray Serrato, who tackled state-sanctioned campaigns at the social media company, told me how his former team was ""decimated"" after the takeover.According to him, that means a number of key experts who ""covered special regions"" - including in the Middle East - and whose job it was to deal with specific co-ordinated disinformation operations, are no longer at the company.X has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The social media site this week said it had removed hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts from the platform.In TikTok's Community Guidelines, the company says it has ""increased dedicated resources to help prevent violent, hateful, or misleading content on TikTok"" in relation to the current situation.The way that disinformation spreads on X, TikTok and other platforms can shape the general public's view of the situation in both Gaza and Israel.That in turn could also put pressure on the politicians making big decisions about what's unfolding.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,12-Oct,"The sound of the first explosion makes everyone jump. It's dark, so we can't see the flares that are starting to fire into the night sky. But we can hear them - first a loud boom, then a long screech as they power out of one country's sky and into another.The nervousness is palpable here on Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The noise overhead has been triggered by a security alert - possible infiltrators from the north. The flares help Israeli soldiers to search for them in the darkness.As the sirens wail, we scramble from our car into a secure shelter with a local security team. They gather around the TV news and turn up their radios tuned in to the army channels, desperate for information. Rumours say it's a drone or glider attack from the north.This time, it turns out to be a false alarm. But over the last few days there have been several exchanges of fire. On Monday, three Israeli soldiers were killed in a confrontation with infiltrators who'd crossed over the border from Lebanon. Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed they were its members.Later, at least three Hezbollah militants were killed as the Israeli military attacked sites in Lebanon in response to mortar fire.Of the 300,000 Israeli reserve soldiers being mobilised right now in response to Saturday's unprecedented attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants from Gaza, a large chunk are being sent to reinforce this northern border.At the rendezvous points around here they're arriving all the time to report for duty. Vehicles spill out of overflowing car parks and empty coaches line the streets. In one bus stop a group of green-clad soldiers shelter from the sun, relaxing on the ground to save their energy until it's needed.Most people you meet proudly tell you about family members who are on their way to serve. Those who aren't needed yet - like two medics we meet - explain how they're instead using their time to take supplies of food, water and extra essentials like mobile phone power banks to colleagues.As we try to grab some food after a long day, one local takeaway is running out of ingredients after using them all to bake hundreds of pizzas to take to soldiers.The large troop build-up is all because another, different militant group poses a significant threat here on the northern border. Hezbollah - like Hamas - has been designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other countries.Backed by Iran, it has a strong military and political presence in Lebanon, and wields considerable power in a country without a functioning government or president. In 2006, it fought a devastating war with Israel in which 1,200 people died.For days there have been exchanges of fire across the border between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. Palestinian militant groups in Lebanon have been involved too.All of this is dangerous. If the situation escalates and a new front opens up in this war - plunging Israel into another full-scale conflict with Lebanon - the effect would reverberate around the region.It would have an impact further afield too, which is one of the reasons why the US in particular is helping the Israeli military, and vocally telling the world it's prepared to help Israel defend itself against all attacks.The arrival of a first shipment of US arms in Israel and the deployment of a US aircraft carrier in the eastern Mediterranean has backed up those words with actions.Right at the grassroots, people are doing what they can to protect themselves too. Adeeb Mazal is part of the emergency team in his northern Israeli village, which nestles right next to the imposing border wall with Lebanon.Hezbollah observation towers are clearly visible, rising above it at regular intervals. Dressed in black and wearing sturdy boots, Adeeb describes how communities like his rely on their own armed security squads to protect them from potential attacks.""We have a very small group of volunteer men,"" he tells me. ""I think we need at least 20 people - because we are on the border - but we are only five.""We ask all the time for more people and more weapons, we can't defend the village like this. We're hoping the authorities will give us as many as 30 men.""Adeeb also talks about a time when this village didn't have a border running through it. ""These organisations do not distinguish between Jews and Arabs,"" he says. ""We are Arabs, we have a mosque, and they continue to harm the village.""The day before we met, Adeeb's team had sprung into action.""There was an infiltration of some terrorists from Lebanon and we had to go to the shelters, all of the residents,"" he said.We and the army went to a defence post, there were some shootings and wounded on our side. We are now trying to keep to a regular life, but we're asking people always to be close to a bomb shelter.""© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,15-Oct,"The Israel-Gaza war is reverberating around the world. In Manchester - a diverse city with large Jewish and Muslim populations - people are anxious about what it could mean for their communities.On Wednesday, in the centre of Manchester, around 1,500 people packed into St Peter's Square for a vigil. Israel flags were waved throughout the crowd. Placards with pictures of the Israeli dead were held. Some people shed tears, but mainly there was a strong feeling of solidarity.""We believe that every single Jew shares a bit of the same soul,"" says Eli Dresner, 25. ""We're all family, we all come from the same place.  Even if I don't know them, if I see another Jew, they are family.""As well as the profound sense of connection that comes with shared history and trauma, a relatively small global community of 16 million Jews means that many in the UK know people in Israel.""I've got family in Israel who have all been called up to serve, and almost everyone here will know someone who is stuck,"" says Mr Dresner.Scores of police officers were on duty at the vigil, and there were tangible concerns about a potential rise in hate crimes against Jews among those who attended.""All this just for some Jewish people to gather together,"" says 18-year-old Eli Hassell, ""there wouldn't ever be that many police officers if there wasn't a real threat.""The Community Security Trust, a charity that provides security and advice for British Jews, says it has recorded a sixfold increase in antisemitic incidents compared to the same week last year.""Someone was just telling me they were threatened on the tram yesterday,"" Eli says. ""Seven or eight young lads came up to him saying Jewish blood will be all over the UK.""He believes most people in diverse cities like Manchester want to get along, but he thinks some parts of the media ""push people towards one side or another"".Twenty-five-year-old Eli Dresner says the people he interacts with are not interested in an increase in tension in the city.""I have friends who are pro-Palestinian and we've managed to have constructive conversations - because we know each other from outside this kind of situation,"" he says.Not far from St Peter's Square is Cheetham Hill Road, in north Manchester, a neighbourhood dotted with halal butchers and mosques.A short walk away there are numerous synagogues and kosher shops - this is where Manchester's Jewish and Muslim communities meet.""As Muslims we have built fantastic bridges with the Jewish community here,"" says Talat Ali, 54, an IT worker who used to work with aid organisations in Gaza.When he heard the news about the Hamas attack last Saturday, Mr Ali says he messaged his Jewish friends in Manchester to ask if they were OK.Since then, he has also tried to contact Palestinians he knows in Gaza, to check if they are safe. He says he has had no replies.Like many other prominent Muslims in Manchester, Mr Ali is anxious about speaking to the media, worried that comments expressing concern for Palestinians could be misconstrued as somehow being anti-Jewish.""There's a fear factor of repercussions,"" he says, feeling that his community is suddenly in the spotlight. ""Even today as the only Muslim walking into a meeting, I felt I was getting certain stares.""Zara Mohammed, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), says in recent days Muslims in the UK have faced a rise in prejudice being expressed.""Just this morning I received calls from some mosques who have had some hate crime incidents and who are now talking to the police,"" Ms Mohammed says, ""and what we're seeing online is a lot of Islamophobic tropes.""There are undeniably strong feelings over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, she says, but, like Talat Ali, she speaks to the nervousness among British Muslims.""I think people are feeling really troubled, but I think there's a real concern that advocating for Palestine is conflated with being antisemitic,"" she says.When asked about the MCB's stance on Hamas, something that has been the subject of recent newspaper reports, the body's secretary general looks exasperated.""I don't speak for Hamas, we're a British organisation and we do not endorse or advocate for any terrorist organisation of any kind, and the MCB views it [Hamas] as such, completely in line with the government,"" Ms Mohammed says.Even being asked the question about Hamas is part of the problem, she says - and one that many British Muslims are facing.""If you're a Muslim and you're speaking on the issue, it's 'do you support terrorists?'"" she says.Many Jews at this week's vigil as well as Muslims in north Manchester talked of mistrust of the media and the language that is being used. People of both communities talked of their fears of acts of hate.Most people we spoke to in Manchester did not view this as a situation that pitted Jews against Muslims. But there was a shared concern that relationships - which have been built up between communities in cities like this - will feel the strain in the weeks to come.Additional reporting by Harry Farley.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,11-Oct,"As hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops, regular and reservist, gather on Gaza's borders, the Israeli government faces a near impossible situation.At least 150 hostages seized by Hamas gunmen from southern Israel last Saturday are now being held at secret locations inside Gaza. Among them are women, children and the elderly.If Israel decides to launch a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza, as some are expecting could be imminent, then what are the chances those hostages will survive?Behind the scenes, Qatar, Egypt and possibly other countries are believed to be trying to negotiate a partial release of those hostages. One idea being mooted is for Hamas to release its women and child prisoners in exchange for 36 Palestinian women and adolescent prisoners being held in Israeli jails.But Michael Milstein, Senior Analyst at the Institute for Policy and Strategy at Israel's Reichman University, told me that while in normal times the number one priority for Israel would be the return of those hostages, today it is the elimination of Hamas as a military threat.With tensions and anger sky-high on both sides, neither Israel nor Hamas are in the mood for compromise or concessions. Israelis are shocked and outraged that gunmen were able to breach their southern border so easily and then murder at least 1,200 people, most in cold blood.Palestinians, and not just Hamas, are reeling from the onslaught of more than 2,000 Israeli airstrikes on Gaza that have killed more than 1,000 people since Saturday. Gaza has been cut off from fuel, electricity, water and medicine.Hamas has threatened to ""execute"" one hostage for each time an Israeli airstrike kills civilians without warning. There is no evidence they have done so yet. At the same time there is little sign of restraint from Israel. Large parts of Gaza are being intentionally reduced to rubble.However Milstein believes that Hamas may not be keen to hold on to its women, children and the elderly. They are bad optics for the group internationally and many will require a high degree of care, not easy amid constant air strikes and when Hamas are trying to keep their location secret from any covert informants Israel may have inside Gaza.By contrast, Hamas will want to take maximum advantage of any serving military personnel it holds, extracting the highest price for their release if negotiations take place.This leaves the Israeli government with a dilemma when it comes to the hostages. Does it attempt an armed rescue mission, something fraught with risks? Or does it wait for longer, until Hamas is so weakened by airstrikes, that it might be more willing to make a deal?That option carries its own risks. Although the hostages are thought to be held below ground in tunnels and bunkers, they may not be immune to these airstrikes. There is always the risk that their captors could kill them, either in a fit of rage or if they feared they were on the point of being rescued. This happened in Nigeria in 2012 during a failed UK-Nigerian Special Forces mission to rescue two hostages held by jihadists.Israel has been quick to set up a Hostage Situation Room, collating everything it knows on the identity and status of each of the hostages who were dragged at gunpoint across the border into Gaza on Saturday.Those who were still being held on Israeli territory were rescued by Israeli military and police Special Forces, with all their Hamas captors killed. But Michael Milstein, who spent 20 years in Israeli military intelligence, warns that ""we don't have all the data on every house and street in Gaza"". This is where Hamas are on home ground, able to conceal both themselves and their hostages in a network of underground cellars and tunnels.Israel has a well-proven expertise in hostage rescue, which it trains for intensively. Set up in 1957, its secretive Sayeret Matkal unit is broadly similar to Britain's SAS or America's Delta Force. It shot to fame in 1976 with its Raid on Entebbe where its commandos rescued hostages from a hijacked plane at a Ugandan airport.The commander of that unit was Yonatan Netanyahu, the only fatality amongst the Israeli commandos. Today his brother Benjamin is Israel's Prime Minister and it is with him that the decision rests as to whether to wait it out in the hopes of a negotiated release of the hostages or go in hard in the hopes of rescuing them by force.Reports are emerging that the US is providing assistance with intelligence data and possibly even support from its own Special Forces. A large US Navy carrier group is positioning itself offshore in the eastern Mediterranean.But Hamas have shown themselves capable of asymmetric warfare, of being able to make up for Israel's massive advantage in technology and firepower.By avoiding leaving a digital trail in their communications and keeping those communications to a minimum, they were able to take Israel by surprise on 7 October. Their gunmen who are currently holding those 150-plus hostages will be staying offline and off the airwaves as far as possible and will almost certainly have removed every digital device from their captives.""This is without question,"" says Michael Milstein, ""the most difficult hostage situation Israel has ever faced in its history"".Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

BBC,11-Oct,"This video can not be playedWatch: James Cleverly runs for cover as sirens blare in IsraelThe UK backs Israel's self-defence but is keen to see as few civilian casualties as possible, James Cleverly has said on a visit to the country.It comes as the Israeli government continues to retaliate following the attacks by Hamas last weekend.The foreign secretary was earlier seen dashing into a building as warning sirens started.His visit is to signal the UK's ""unwavering solidarity"" with Israel, a Foreign Office spokesperson said.Speaking to reporters in Israel, Mr Cleverly said the country had a right to defend itself and also to ""try and regain those people who have been kidnapped"".He added that he had discussed Israel's work to minimise the risk to non-combatants, saying ""we would want to see as few civilian casualties as possible"".But he warned: ""Hamas habitually embeds its military capability, its terrorist capability, within civilian populations.""The UK and US governments have given firm backing to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration in the wake of Saturday's attacks.There are fears that the conflict, which has claimed at least 1,200 lives in Israel - and more than 1,000 people in Israeli air strikes on Gaza - could escalate further.Attacks on Gaza continued on Wednesday as Israel targets Hamas. However, concerns have been expressed in the United Nations and elsewhere about the impact on civilians.The Israeli government has stopped the passage of food, water, fuel and medicine into the territory, with the sole remaining access from Egypt shut down on Tuesday after air strikes near the border crossing.Defence Secretary Grant Shapps earlier said that while Israel needed to respect international law, the UK would ""absolutely defend Israel's right to do what they need to do now to go after Hamas"".Support for Israel was echoed by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.Meanwhile, King Charles is ""appalled by and condemns the barbaric acts of terrorism in Israel"", according to Buckingham Palace sources.At least 17 British nationals, including children, are dead or missing, an official UK source told the BBC.Concerns have also been raised for the safety of British citizens who wish to leave Israel.Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said he had asked the Foreign Office for clarity on the help being offered.In a letter to Mr Cleverly, he said: ""While Israeli airspace has not officially been closed, most UK airlines have been forced to cancel their flights for the foreseeable future.""This is obviously deeply concerning for all those who are desperate to return to loved ones in the UK.""Several countries... have announced rescue flights to return their nationals who are stranded. Does the UK government have plans to do the same?""British Airways has now suspended flights to Israel after one of its plane returned to London shortly before arriving in Tel Aviv.Both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Suella Braverman have stressed the need to protect the UK's Jewish community.Ms Braverman told police chiefs on Tuesday that waving a Palestinian flag on British streets ""may not be legitimate"" if it is deemed to be a show of support for acts of terrorism.Labour's Sir Keir suggested that flag-waving could be an issue in certain contexts.He added: ""It's very important that at times like this we don't conflate peaceful discussion of Palestinian issues with Hamas.""© 2023 BBC.

BBC,11-Oct,"More than 75 years after Israel declared statehood, its borders are yet to be entirely settled. Wars, treaties and occupation mean the shape of the Jewish state has changed over time, and in parts is still undefined. Here is a series of maps explaining why.The land which would become Israel was for centuries part of the Turkish-ruled Ottoman Empire. After World War One and the collapse of the empire, territory known as Palestine - the portion of which west of the River Jordan was also known as the land of Israel by Jews - was marked out and assigned to Britain to administer by the victorious allied powers (soon after endorsed by the League of Nations).The terms of the mandate entrusted Britain with establishing in Palestine ""a national home for the Jewish people"", so long as doing so did not prejudice the civil and religious rights of non-Jewish communities there.The rise of Palestinian Arab nationalism coupled with the rapid growth of Palestine's smaller Jewish population - especially after the advent of Nazism in the 1930s - saw an escalation in Arab-Jewish violence in Palestine.Britain handed the problem to the United Nations, which in 1947 proposed partitioning Palestine into two states - one Jewish, one Arab - with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area to become an international city. The plan was accepted by Palestine's Jewish leadership but rejected by Arab leaders.The Jewish leadership in Palestine declared the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the moment the British mandate terminated, though without announcing its borders.The following day Israel was invaded by five Arab armies, marking the start of Israel's War of Independence. The fighting ended in 1949 with a series of ceasefires, producing armistice lines along Israel's frontiers with neighbouring states, and creating the boundaries of what became known as the Gaza Strip (occupied by Egypt) and East Jerusalem and the West Bank (occupied by Jordan).The surrounding Arab states refused to recognise Israel, meaning its borders remained unset.The biggest change to Israel's frontiers came in 1967, when the conflict known as the Six Day War left Israel in occupation of the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and most of the Syrian Golan Heights - effectively tripling the size of territory under Israel's control. Israel effectively annexed East Jerusalem - claiming the whole of the city as its capital - and the Golan Heights.These moves were not recognised by the international community, until the US changed its official position on the matter under the Trump administration, becoming the first major power to do so. Overwhelmingly, international opinion continues to consider East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as occupied territory.One of Israel's land borders was formalised for the first time in 1979, when Egypt became the first Arab country to recognise the Jewish state. Under the treaty, Israel's border with Egypt was set and Israel withdrew all its forces and settlers from the Sinai, a process which was completed in 1982.That left Israel in occupation of the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, with its frontiers (excluding that of Egypt) still delineated by the 1949 armistice lines.In 1994, Jordan became the second Arab state to recognise Israel, formalising its long border with the Jewish state in the process. While there has not yet been a peace treaty between Israel and Lebanon, the two countries' 1949 armistice line serves as Israel's de facto northern border, while Israel's border with Syria remains unsettled.Similarly, Israel has had a de facto border with Gaza since it pulled its troops and settlers out in 2005, but Gaza and the West Bank are considered a single occupied entity by the UN, and the official borders have not yet been determined.The final status and contours of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem are meant to be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians living there under Israeli occupation, but decades of on-off talks have so far proved fruitless.The border around the Gaza Strip has grown into a semi-permanent structure with security fences and concrete walls set deep into the ground to prevent tunnelling - after Hamas militants launched a series of raids from tunnels into Israel in 2014. However, Hamas militants again breached the security barriers above ground in the biggest attack of its kind on 7 October, 2023.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,13-Oct,"In the days immediately after the Hamas attack on Israel, the Republicans seeking the US presidency had focused their criticism on President Joe Biden and what they saw as American weakness and missteps that had paved the way for violence.That changed on Wednesday night, however, when Donald Trump addressed the topic in a speech near his home in West Palm Beach, Florida.Now some of Mr Trump's rivals are condemning the former president in some of the most direct language of this campaign.During remarks to a crowd of supporters, Mr Trump said Israel had to ""straighten it out because they're fighting, potentially a very big force"".He called Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant a ""jerk"" and repeatedly called Hezbollah, the militant Islamist group in Lebanon, ""very smart"".Mr Trump also said that Israel had initially agreed to work with the US on a 2020 drone strike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, but that they backed out at the last minute.""I'll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down,"" he said. ""That was a very terrible thing.""In a television interview that aired Thursday, he went further in his criticism of the Israeli prime minister, saying Mr Netanyahu was ""not very prepared"" for the possibility of a Hamas attack.Mr Trump's remarks prompted a series of quick and pointed responses from Ron DeSantis, the candidate who once was in a dead heat with the former president but now trails him in most polls by a wide margin.""Terrorists have murdered at least 1,200 Israelis and 22 Americans and are holding more hostage,"" the Florida governor wrote in a social media post, ""so it is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for president, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists.""A DeSantis campaign spokesperson would later call Mr Trump's remarks ""disturbing and disqualifying"".Mr Trump's former vice-president, Mike Pence, noted a pattern in his old boss's foreign policy statements.""Hezbollah aren't smart, they're evil,"" he said in a radio interview on Thursday.""But the former president also said when Russia invaded Ukraine in a similar, unprovoked, unconscionable invasion a year-and-a-half ago, he said Vladimir Putin was a genius.""The former president's campaign team on Thursday attempted to explain Mr Trump's comments in a social media post on Thursday, writing, ""smart does not equal good"" - an effort the DeSantis campaign called ""rhetorical gymnastics"".Mr Trump's comments also prompted a response from Israeli communications minister Shlomo Karhi, who called it ""shameful"".""A former US president abets propaganda and disseminates things that wound the spirit of Israel's fighters and its citizens,"" he said on Israeli television.""We don't have to bother with him and the nonsense he spouts.""During his presidency, Mr Trump was a vocal and aggressive supporter of Israel and its right-wing Likud government.In 2018, he relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move that past US leaders had been reluctant to make because of diplomatic blowback.It won him an outpouring of support from many Israelis.But he has harboured a grudge against Mr Netanyahu since the 2020 US presidential election, when the Israeli prime minister called to congratulate Mr Biden on his victory while Mr Trump was still contesting the voting results.It's yet another indication that for Mr Trump, his foreign policy views and statements can be determined as much by personal issues as political ones.Democrats are facing their own divisions on the topic, as sympathies towards the Palestinian situation that have grown more pronounced in recent years clash with an outpouring of support and anger over the Hamas attacks.Within the left-wing progressive movement, cracks have been forming.Two liberal House Democrats in Michigan, Rashida Tlaib and Shri Thanedar, clashed over the latter's criticism of members of Congress who call Hamas ""resistance"" or ""militants"".Ms Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, said Mr Thanedar was more interested in generating social media attention than helping his constituents.Earlier this week, some House Democrats exchanged heated words behind closed doors over the Israel attacks, reportedly after Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said that anyone in Congress who hasn't condemned the attack should feel guilty.Mr Trump isn't the only Republican presidential hopeful who has discovered that the Hamas attack on Israel can be somewhat treacherous political ground, either.Mr DeSantis himself was put on the defensive while campaigning in New Hampshire on Thursday, as a voter wondered why the Florida governor was not also expressing sympathy for Palestinian civilians who have been killed by Israeli bombing campaigns.""They are not decapitating babies' heads,"" Mr DeSantis said, in reference to unconfirmed reports of specific Hamas atrocities on Saturday. ""They are not intentionally doing that.""The man, who said he had voted for Mr Trump in the past, told Mr DeSantis he had lost his support.Meanwhile, Vivek Ramaswamy - the tech entrepreneur and political novice who is currently close to Mr DeSantis in recent Republican polls - instigated his own round of criticism when he said that the many Republicans expressing support for Israel after the Hamas attack were engaging in ""selective moral outrage"" based on campaign contributions and deep-pocketed donors.""It is shameful,"" he said. ""And I think that there are, frankly, financial and corrupting influences that lead them exactly to speak the way they do, that's just the hard truth.""That prompted a back-and-forth on social media with Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas, who called Mr Ramaswamy a ""Hamas apologist"" and a ""clown"".The Republican race has been remarkably stable over recent months, as Mr Trump has built and maintained a sizable lead over his opponents through a variety of legal and political drama.The conflict in Israel, however, has created a new turbulence in US and global politics that could continue to cause headaches for Democrats - and, possibly, give Mr Trump's rivals an opening to exploit.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,13-Oct,"This video can not be playedScotland's FM Humza Yousaf says the situation in Gaza, where he has family, is ""a human catastrophe"".Scotland's first minister has said Israel is ""going too far"" and that innocent civilians in Gaza can not simply be ""collateral damage"".Humza Yousaf had earlier shared a video of his mother-in-law, Elizabeth El-Nakla, describing the situation on the ground.She issued an emotional plea for help after Israel warned more than a million people to flee north Gaza.Mr Yousaf said she was in a ""real state of distress"".He said it was ""really difficult"" to watch the video, and spoke of his sense of ""helplessness and distress"".Mr Yousaf added that it was important to share the video so people could see that his mother-in-law, like ordinary citizens of Gaza, had nothing to do with Hamas.Calling on the international community to ""step up"", he said there needed to be a ceasefire and a humanitarian corridor to allow supplies and to allow people out.""There is a humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding and the collective punishment of 2.2 million Gazans just can not be justified,"" he said.Mr Yousaf stressed he had ""entire and absolute sympathy"" with the men, women and children who lost their lives in Israel.At least 1,300 people were killed when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on 7 October.The victims included grandfather Bernard Cowan, who grew up in the Glasgow area before moving to live in Israel.On Thursday, Mr Yousaf comforted Mr Cowan's mother when they both attended a service of solidarity at Giffnock Newton Mearns Synagogue in East Renfrewshire.The UN said Israel was telling everyone to relocate to the south of Gaza in the next 24 hours, a move it warned would have ""devastating humanitarian consequences"".This video can not be playedMs El-Nakla's mother, Elizabeth, with her twin grandsons, who had their ninth birthday on WednesdayPalestinian health officials say 1,400 people have died in Israeli retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza as the death toll continues to rise in the conflict.Earlier this week Mr Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, told BBC News her family were ""terrified"" and some of her relatives' homes have already been destroyed.Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband, Maged, had travelled to the south of the Palestinian enclave last week to see a sick relative.The couple, from Dundee, are now trapped in a war zone with no way out.On Friday, Mr Yousaf shared a moving 40-second video from his mother-in-law on X, formerly known as Twitter.Looking directly into the camera Ms El-Nakla said: ""This will be my last video.""Everybody from Gaza is moving towards where we are. One million people. No food. No water.""And still they are bombing them as they leave. Where are we going to put them?""The grandmother became tearful as she continued: ""But my thought is all these people in the hospital cannot be evacuated. Where's humanity? Where's people's hearts in the world to let this happen in this day and age?""May God help us. Bye.""Mr and Mrs El-Nakla are in Gaza visiting their son - a father-of-four - and Mr El-Nakla's 92-year-old mother, who is ill.This video can not be playedNadia El-Nakla tells of her fears for the future of her family trapped in GazaAsked how his family were coping, Mr Yousaf said: ""There is a sense of helplessness and distress and every day that goes on you fear the situation.""I just had a message from my mother-in-law, all of 15 minutes ago, to say that there is now bombing in their neighbourhood.""The first minister added that with every passing day the family's meagre rations diminish and they will be placed under further strain when relatives flee the north of Gaza to join them.Mr Yousaf said: ""That house of 10 could potentially have 40 people in it by the end of this day with just a few plastic bottles of clean drinking water and rationing of supplies.""So it is a human catastrophe and the international community really needs to step up.""All movement into and out of Gaza is controlled by the Israeli authorities, except the pedestrian-only Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai peninsula, which is controlled by the Egyptian authorities.This has come under bombardment from Israel in recent days and, according to the BBC's Egypt correspondent Sally Nabil, Egyptians are concerned about being dragged into the conflict.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,13-Oct,"It's tempting to view Vladimir Putin as a James Bond-style villain sitting at a giant control panel, in a mountain hideout, sowing chaos around the world.He presses one button and there's unrest in the Balkans.He presses another and the Middle East explodes.It's tempting… but probably inaccurate. It exaggerates the Kremlin leader's global influence.Yes, Russia has ties to Hamas and has become a close ally of Iran. According to the US, Moscow and Teheran now have a fully-fledged defence partnership.But that doesn't mean Moscow had direct involvement in, or prior knowledge of the Hamas attack on Israel.""We do not believe that Russia was involved in any way,"" Israel's ambassador to Moscow, Alexander Ben Zvi, told the Kommersant newspaper this week, adding that it was ""complete nonsense"" to suggest there was a Russian connection to the atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel.""I haven't seen any evidence of direct Russian weapons supplies to Hamas, or of the Russian military training Hamas operatives,"" says Hanna Notte, a Berlin-based expert on Russia and the Middle East at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.""It's true that Russia has a long relationship with Hamas. Russia never declared Hamas a terrorist organisation. Hamas delegations were in Moscow last year and this year.""But I would not infer from that that there has been extensive military support. Even though we know that Russian-made systems made their way into the Gaza strip, probably via the Sinai [in Egypt] and with Iranian assistance.""In other words, President Putin didn't press a button marked ""Middle East war"".But is he ready to take advantage?Absolutely. And here's how.With the upsurge in violence in the Middle East dominating the international news agenda, Moscow is counting on dramatic headlines from Israel to divert attention from Russia's war in Ukraine.But this is about more than just changing the news cycle. The Russian authorities are also hoping that, as a result of the situation in the Middle East, some Western arms supplies to Ukraine will be redirected to Israel.""I believe this crisis will directly influence the course of the special military operation [in Ukraine],"" Russian diplomat Konstantin Gavrilov told the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper.""Ukraine's sponsors will be distracted by the conflict in Israel. That doesn't mean that the West will abandon Ukrainians. But the amount of military aid will go down….and the course of the operation may turn sharply in [Russia's] favour.""Wishful thinking on Russia's part? Quite possibly.""We can and will stand by Israel, even as we stand by Ukraine,"" said US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin at a meeting of Nato defence ministers.But a protracted conflict in the Middle East will test America's capacity to simultaneously support two allies in two separate wars.Russia is trying to boost its role in the Middle East by styling itself as a potential peacemaker.It has been in that role before, joining in past international efforts to end the conflict in the region.""Russia can and will play a role in the resolution [of the conflict],"" said President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""We're maintaining contacts with sides in the conflict.""On a visit to Moscow this week, Iraq's prime minister called on President Putin to ""announce an initiative for a real ceasefire"" in the region.Russia the peacemaker? That's a hard sell.After all, this is the country that launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour. After nearly 20 months, Russia's war in Ukraine has caused death and destruction on a scale that has shocked the world.Plus, saying you ""can and will play a role"" in achieving peace doesn't guarantee that those involved in the conflict will accept you as a mediator.Moscow has long had an interest in the Middle East, with the Soviet Union adopting a pro-Arab position as Israel forged a close bond with the US. For years state-sponsored antisemitism was a feature of Soviet life.After the break-up of the Soviet empire Russia's relations with Israel improved, partly because of an influx of more than a million Jews to Israel from former Soviet republics.But more recently Vladimir Putin's Russia has drawn closer to Israel's enemies, particularly Iran - putting Russian-Israeli relations under strain.The Kremlin spies an opportunity here to do what it already does plenty of - blaming America.Since the Hamas attack on Israel, Vladimir Putin's central message has been that ""this is an example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East"".It fits the general pattern of Moscow attacking what it calls ""US hegemony"".And framing America as the central culprit in the Middle East is the Kremlin's way of bolstering Russia's standing in the region at Washington's expense.So far I've talked about the potential benefits for Russia from events in the Middle East. But there are dangers, too.""Carefully calibrated instability is what serves Russia best,"" believes Hanna Notte.""If this crisis diverts attention from Ukraine - and there's a real risk of that, given the importance of Israel in the US domestic political context - yes, Russia could be a short-term beneficiary.""But Russia would not benefit from a war that draws in the broader region, including Iran which provides weapons and finance to Hamas, Ms Notte says.""Russia doesn't want a full-blown war between Israel and Iran. If things drift towards that, and it becomes clear America comes down hard on Israel's side, I think Russia will see no choice but to drift further to the Iranian side. I'm not sure that it wants to.""I think Putin still values his ties with Israel. I don't think Russian diplomacy wants to move into that space where they have to pick sides. But the more this conflict escalates, the more they might feel the pressure.""© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,13-Oct-23,"The leader of Hamas in Gaza has previously claimed that it has 500km of tunnelsIsrael says it is striking parts of a secret labyrinth of tunnels built underneath the Gaza Strip by Hamas, as it continues to retaliate for the Palestinian Islamist militant group's unprecedented cross-border attack on Saturday.""Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas. We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built,"" an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said in a video on Thursday.""These aren't bunkers for Gazan civilians. It's only for Hamas and other terrorists so that they can continue to fire rockets at Israel, to plan operations, to launch terrorists into Israel,"" they claimed.It is very difficult to assess the size of the network, which Israel has dubbed the ""Gaza Metro"" because it is believed to stretch beneath a territory that is only 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.Following a conflict in 2021, the IDF said it had destroyed more than 100km of tunnels in air strikes. Hamas meanwhile claimed that its tunnels stretched 500km and that only 5% were hit. To put those figures into perspective, the London Underground is 400km long and is mostly above ground.Tunnel construction began in Gaza before Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005.But it was ramped up after Hamas took control of the Strip two years later, which prompted Israel and Egypt to begin restricting the movement of goods and people in and out for security reasons.At its peak, almost 2,500 tunnels running underneath the Egyptian border were used to smuggle in commercial goods, fuel and weapons by Hamas and other militant groups.The smuggling became less important to Gaza after 2010, when Israel began allowing more goods to be imported through its crossings. Egypt later shut the smuggling down by flooding or destroying the tunnels.Tunnels were dug under the Egyptian border to bring in all kinds of goods and weaponsHamas and other factions also started digging tunnels to attack Israeli forces.In 2006, militants used one underneath the border with Israel to kill two Israeli soldiers and seize a third, Gilad Shalit, who they held captive for five years.In 2013, the IDF discovered a 1.6km-long, 18m-deep tunnel lined with a concrete roof and walls leading from the Strip to land near an Israeli kibbutz after residents heard strange sounds.The following year, Israel cited the need to eradicate the threat of attacks by militants using such ""terror tunnels"" under the frontier for a major air and ground offensive in Gaza.The IDF said its forces destroyed more than 30 tunnels during the war. But a group of militants were also able to use one to mount an attack in which four Israeli soldiers were killed.""The cross-border tunnels tend to be rudimentary, meaning they have barely any fortification. They are dug for a one-time purpose - invading Israeli territory,"" says Dr Daphné Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare who teaches at Reichman University in Israel.""The tunnels inside Gaza are different because Hamas is using them on a regular basis. They are probably more comfortable to be in for longer periods of time. They are definitely equipped for a longer, sustained presence.""""The leaders are hiding there, they have command-and-control centres, they use them for transport and lines of communication. They are equipped with electricity, lighting and rail tracks. You can move around more and stand.""She says Hamas appears to have ""perfected the art"" of tunnel building and warfare in recent years, having learned a huge amount by observing the tactics of Syrian rebel fighters in Aleppo and jihadist militants from the Islamic State (IS) group in Mosul.The tunnels inside Gaza are believed to be as much as 30m (100ft) below the surface and have entrances located on the bottom floors of houses, mosques, schools and other public buildings to allow militants to evade detection.Building the network has also come at a cost to the local population. The IDF has accused Hamas of diverting millions of dollars given to Gaza in aid to pay for the tunnels as well as tens of thousands of tons of cement intended for rebuilding homes destroyed in previous wars.It is possible that a cross-border tunnel was used by Hamas militants during last weekend's attacks in Israel, in which at least 1,300 people were killed, most of them civilians, and more than 150 others were taken as hostages. There were reports that a tunnel exit was discovered near the kibbutz of Kfar Aza, where dozens of civilians were massacred.If that is confirmed, the tunnel would have been built beneath the underground concrete barrier studded with sophisticated anti-tunnel detection sensors which Israel finished installing at the end of 2021.Dr Richemond-Barak says it would be a shock, but stresses that no tunnel detection system is fool-proof. ""This is why tunnels have been used for time immemorial in war, because is there no way to prevent them.""She also cautions that it is unrealistic for the Israeli establishment and general public to believe it will be possible for the IDF to destroy Hamas's entire network of tunnels in Gaza, as hundreds of thousands of troops mass nearby for a possible ground operation.""There will be parts of the network where civilians, for whatever reason, will not evacuate... Some parts of the underground network are unknown. And for some of them the collateral damage will be too high.""Destroying the tunnels will also lead to a significant loss of life - among Israeli forces on the ground, Palestinian civilians and the hostages, she warns.More than 1,500 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them civilians, have already been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes since Saturday.""Hamas is very good at using human shields. Once a strike is imminent and they know it, they will put innocent civilians on top of buildings. That has forced Israel to cancel strikes many times,"" Dr Richemond-Barak says.""Having mastered the technique, Hamas could easily use it in the context of the tunnels and simply put Israeli, American and other hostages inside them.""During the 2021 conflict, a series of devastating air strikes in Gaza City brought three residential buildings crashing to the ground, killing 42 people. The IDF said it targeted underground tunnels, but that when they collapsed the building's foundations collapsed too.Three buildings collapsed in Gaza City in 2021 after tunnels nearby were hit in an Israeli air strikeThe tunnel network will also negate the advantages that the IDF has in terms of technology and intelligence, magnify the difficulties of urban warfare, and pose a lethal threat to Israeli troops, according to Dr Richemond-Barak.""First of all, Hamas has had plenty of time to booby-trap the entire network,"" she says ""They could just let the soldiers enter into the tunnel network and then eventually blow the whole thing up.""""They could kidnap [the soldiers in surprise attacks]. And then you have all the other risks - running out of oxygen, fighting the enemy in one-on-one combat, and rescuing wounded soldiers becomes virtually impossible.""She adds: ""Even if you don't go inside the tunnel, to secure an area where you suspect that tunnels might be present is very different from just securing an area in general. Here, you have to secure something that is invisible.""The Israeli forces will, however, have some ways to mitigate the risks.According to Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group security consultancy, these might include sending drones and unmanned vehicles into tunnels to map them and identify booby traps before soldiers clear them.Warplanes could also drop ""bunker busting"" bombs, which penetrate deep into the ground before detonating. However, they would pose a risk of collateral damage due to the dense urban terrain.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,13-Oct,"""God Forbid.""Shortly after sunrise on the morning of Saturday 7 October, a message pings on 200 phones of the Be'eri mothers' WhatsApp group.Minutes later another message lands: ""We have a terrorist on the stairs. Call someone.""WARNING: Some readers may find details in this article distressing.Hamas gunmen had just begun a day-long rampage through this kibbutz in southern Israel, and over the next 20 hours the women channelled their horror, disbelief and reassurances through the chat - as militants roamed the neighbourhood shooting residents dead and setting fire to homes.Hiding in their safe rooms these women - some huddled with their families - described the shouts and explosions they heard outside, told each other where gunmen were, shared tips on coping with smoke that filled their rooms, and repeatedly called for help. In some cases, that help never came.As the hours ticked by, they asked questions. Where was the army? Why was help taking so long? Can somebody please look for my mother? How do I lock my safe room? Should we open the door to a man claiming to be a soldier?At some point, somebody changed the name of the group to ""Be'eri Mothers Emergency"".This group chat was shared with the BBC by a woman put forward by the community to speak to the media in the wake of the attacks. She is one of the mothers on the chat and shared the details with us so we could see how the terror of the day unfolded - and what a lifeline these women were in the most desperate and sometimes final hours of their lives.We could not seek the permission of all 200 members, but three of them agreed to tell us their stories in detail, and we have anonymised all other exchanges, being careful to ensure nobody can be identified to protect their privacy.Some members are unaccounted for, presumed dead or missing. Survivors estimate that about 100 people were killed and many were taken away as hostages.Minute-by-minute, this chat reveals in detail not seen before how Hamas stalked, murdered and burned people in their own homes, coming back again and again. It is an insight into what it felt like across southern Israel as Hamas gunmen crashed across the border and tore through dozens of communities.It shows how residents survived and supported one another - but it also documents, hour by hour, their growing desperation, as it became clear they would not be rescued by the Israeli state anytime soon.Dafna Gerster, 39, was visiting from Germany and had spent Friday night with family in the kibbutz she grew up in. They had gathered at her father's house, playing the board game Camel Up into the night - and then she and her husband slept at her brother's apartment nearby knowing the next day was Saturday, the Jewish day of rest, when the families could be together again.The community is next to the Gaza border and is used to missiles - but when Dafna awoke to the scream of rockets at 06:30, she knew immediately that something was different.""Usually you have an alarm and a boom of the iron dome [Israel's missile defence system]. This time, there was no alarm, and it was so loud. It's a sound we could not identify.""I went to my brother's room and asked him 'what is this?'""Like others in the kibbutz they rushed to the safe room or mamad - a room made of reinforced concrete with airtight steel doors and windows designed to withstand rocket attacks.But it soon became clear that rockets were not the only threat. News spread on the WhatsApp group that someone had been shot - and that there were armed men in the streets.CCTV footage verified by the BBC shows a small group of Hamas militants arriving at the gate of the kibbutz before 06:00. A car arrives, the gate opens, and the militants run inside after shooting dead the occupants of the vehicle. Video from a few minutes later shows the same two Hamas militants walking through a square, guns by their side.Fast forward to 07:10, as the first messages on the WhatsApp group are being shared. Video shows three motorbikes, each carrying two heavily armed Hamas militants, leaving the area by the same gate.Other footage, which is too graphic to include here, shows militants in the kibbutz at 09:05 - three hours after first entering. It shows the same car that was shot at in the first clip with at least one body dragged out, lying in the road.This video can not be playedWatch: CCTV shows how Hamas militants broke into Be'eri kibbutzAcross the kibbutz, as the community collectively barricaded themselves into their own mamads, a rising sense of dread on the chat preceded a horrible realisation: many people were struggling to lock their safe room doors.""How do you do an emergency lock? And how do we know that it is really locked?"" one asked.""Can you lock the safe room?"" asked another.""To missiles yes, not to terrorists.""Pictures shared on the WhatsApp group offered tutorials on locking the doors. Those who couldn't feared Hamas would just walk in.At the house of Michal Pinyan, 44, her husband had run out of the safe room to lock the front of the house. The family heard shouting in Arabic outside, followed by gunshots.After rushing back to the safe room, Michal's husband built a locking device with ropes and a baseball bat, which he gripped for the almost 19 hours they spent in the room.In the terrified silence of these safe rooms, where people would not dare scream, they typed frantically. Michal watched the messages stream in.They could not hear what was going on outside except via muffled sounds through the thick walls. But from what little they could make out, they collectively tried to understand what was going on.They shared messages of ""frantic knocking"" on their doors as gunmen went house to house.""Not knocking - it's gunfire,"" one said.During the first hour of the attack, people would tell the group they could hear shooting in their neighbourhood, or outside a particular house. The replies inevitably poured in: ""So do we.""""We understood it wasn't just one terrorist, it was a massive attack,"" Michal says. ""In each neighbourhood of the kibbutz we heard 'they're here, they're here' so they were in each neighbourhood at the same time.""As the scale of the assault became clear, frustrated, fearful posts flooded the chat asking when the army was arriving - and why it wasn't there already.""You can hear shooting close by. Hoping it's the first response squad firing,"" one woman wrote, referring to a small unit in the kibbutz that responds to intruder alerts before handing over to the military.Dafna's brother, Eitan Hadad, was part of that unit and rushed to help, leaving the couple in the safe room.It would be the last time she saw him.""He went out and we stayed in the safe room and it was just horror,"" she says.""You didn't know what was going on, you just hear shooting all the time, bombs, a fight. And it doesn't stop for a minute.""The response unit of roughly 10 people was clearly no match for the Hamas militants.On WhatsApp, people reported more and more gunshots - and men speaking Arabic outside. The desperate pleas for help became more frequent.""I'm home alone and I'm really scared,"" one resident wrote.Elsewhere in the kibbutz, Shir Gutentag was trying to quietly comfort her eight-year-old and five-year-old daughters, while following the WhatsApp chat in disbelief.""At first when I realised we have terrorists in the kibbutz I shook. I was in shock. But very quickly I thought to myself 'you have to stay calm', because they're looking at me, my children, and they see my reactions and they're starting to panic,"" she says.""So I told them it's OK. It's going to be OK.""Hours had passed since the attack started, and the crisis was only worsening. Hamas were breaking into people's homes and threatening safe rooms as members of the chat begged for help.Michal was reading these pleas for help while also messaging her own family in a separate WhatsApp group. She shared the contents of this group with the BBC, giving a terrifying insight into one family's despair as they detailed the Hamas attack in real-time.At around 09:30, Michal's mum wrote on the family chat that she could hear voices in Arabic outside their house. Within 15 minutes another message confirmed that Michal's dad had been hurt.Michal, who had been trying to stay silent in her safe room until this point, simply could not keep quiet anymore and rang her mother. Her mum picked up the phone and whispered.""'They're here, they shot Dad, he's not OK.'""And then she hung up,'"" Michal says.Her mother continued writing on the family chat: ""Help. Help.""Hamas gunmen had used a weapon to break through the safe room door and had shot Michal's father as he tried to fight back. They then threw grenades.Her mum wrote a final plea for help at 10:15. After that, messages from her children went unanswered. She had been killed too.As her parents were being attacked, Michal was desperately messaging in the mothers' chat, calling for someone to help  them. She would continue posting messages about them throughout the day hoping that, somehow, they had survived.She was not the only one. Others were continuously begging for someone, anyone, to check on their parents, friends, cousins. But nobody could: everyone was in the same situation, barricaded in their own mamads.Guns and grenades were Hamas' weapons, but they also set homes on fire.""The entire house is smoke,"" one resident wrote. ""What should I do… tell me what to do.""""We have a fire inside the safe room"", ""The entire window of the safe room is black"", other messages read.On the row of houses closest to Gaza, the home of Dafna's disabled dad, Meir Hadad, was being burned down.In their own family chat, Meir's Filipina carer, 52-year-old Bhing Sol, pleaded with his children to find help.""They're here,"" she wrote, referring to Hamas, in a message at 09:44.""It was full of terrorists,"" Bhing later said, saying they looted the home before setting it on fire.""The safe room was full of smoke. I keep on asking everyone to help us because maybe we'll be burnt alive. But nobody could help us because everyone is terrified.""In the mothers' group, others also asked for help to be sent to Meir.With little anybody could do to answer all these pleas they offered each other practical suggestions - small, homespun survival tips that sustained them, and perhaps even saved lives, in their most powerless moment.This was the spirit of the WhatsApp group - not just today, but for the years it had existed. It was a place for mothers to vent, to give advice, to support one another.""Entire house is full of smoke what should I do?"" someone asked. ""Try to put a wet cloth on your face. Or urine,"" another resident responded.In another exchange, a resident wrote: ""I can't breathe in the house I think there's a fire here help urgently"".""Stay in the safe room don't go out put a piece of cloth on your nose,"" a neighbour replied.While 44-year-old Golan Abidbol's wife and children took shelter in the family's safe room, he stood with a gun in his kitchen, watching Hamas militants throw a molotov cocktail at another building. As he watched, he saw a family jump from the second-floor window and hurry to a neighbour's safe room.""I was pumped up with adrenaline. If someone came to my house I would give them the fight of my life,"" he says.""I sent pictures to the neighbour downstairs because his house started to burn. I told him: 'Now. I don't see anyone. It's a good time.' So he moved to another neighbour's shelter.""Golan says this is the ""essence of the kibbutz"".""We are one big family. If we need to open our door when there are terrorists outside and let the neighbours get in so they can survive, we will do it. No one even hesitated,"" he says.At around midday, two or three men tried to enter Golan's house. He pulled the trigger. ""They returned a burst of fire on the house and then they left. I don't know why they decided to do it but they decided to leave and not engage me anymore,"" he says.At the same time, harrowing messages in the group continued to show that Hamas were breaking into houses and trying to breach safe rooms. ""Firing at our safe room's door,"" one message read. ""Helppp. Anyone.""Meanwhile, at the burning house of Bhing Sol and Meir Hadad, gunmen had begun shooting at the safe room as it filled with smoke.""I took a risk - I opened the window of the safe room, thinking even a little bit of space and the air will come,"" Bhing says.""They kept bombing, with a grenade or something, inside our house. I knew it was burning because the door was so hot it was like fire. But I kept holding the door with a blanket because I didn't know if they could open the door,"" she says.Later in the day, in what Bhing describes as a miracle, a crack formed in the ceiling of the room and water started dripping through onto Meir's head. She grabbed his cheeks in joy after the first drops fell and rubbed her hands over her face.As they waited, the pair could hear hostages being taken past them towards Gaza.""I heard so many people that they brought outside, then I heard shouting, and then Hamas was laughing and rejoicing that they got someone,"" Bhing says.The first reference on the mothers' chat to someone being kidnapped was at 12:09.The BBC has verified footage taken on the day that shows Hamas militants leading five hostages, including an elderly woman, down the road in Be'eri kibbutz - we do not know what time this footage was taken. Israel says that in total 150 people have been kidnapped and taken to Gaza and it is unclear how many were taken from Be'eri kibbutz.As some people were led away by Hamas, others wondered when the army would arrive.Shir Gutentag was reading the messages, while trying to comfort her daughters by continually placing a hand on each of them.""I heard voice messages of terrible things,"" she says. ""There was a woman saying her baby daughter was dead. She was crying for help. Another one saw her mother getting killed, and she's waiting in the safe room for many hours whispering for help saying 'save me, I don't want to die.'""Other WhatsApp messages in the group tell of horrific injuries - including a family member bleeding from a massive wound.There are many messages on this chat, including some describing injuries, but we have not been able to ascertain the fate of everyone who posted.As they sat waiting in the safe rooms for Israeli soldiers to arrive, the residents continued to support one another.Shir made quiet calls to neighbours who had posted messages showing they were in distress, saying ""breathe in with me"".""I posted mainly encouraging things - I'm sure the army's there, I'm sure they're coming. Be patient. Breathe,"" she says.Others in the group did the same.In one exchange, someone asked: ""Is there something someone can say to calm us down?"" Within seconds a neighbour responded: ""I'll tell you,"" before describing how the army would be able to handle it.At around 15:00, Shir got a call from neighbours asking to come into her home because theirs was filling with smoke.She rushed over to her front door, and began dismantling a stack of furniture she had put against it to stop anyone entering and let the family of four through, ushering them to the safe room before reassembling the barricade. A few minutes later, another woman got in touch to ask to enter and Shir began the process again.As her family waited for a rescue they weren't sure would happen, Michal said she put her hands on her three children and ""gave them little kisses, but quietly"".A message on the WhatsApp group offered advice about how to keep children calm. The message said that fear is normal, and to calm children with a hug.In the afternoon, updates shared in the group suggested that IDF soldiers had arrived, and were beginning to make headway. ""The soldiers are now fighting... Two other forces are on their way,"" one message just after 15:30 said.People continued to post their addresses in the hope that someone would come to save them, adding brief information, such as ""terrorists hiding"".But confusion continued to dominate and nobody seemed to know how many soldiers had arrived, or if they were an organised group who could begin to control the situation.People reported hearing shouts of ""IDF, IDF!"" outside, but did not know whether this could be trusted. It could be Hamas in disguise, trying to tempt residents to open up.Golan had continued standing with his gun in his kitchen and he said he could see militants with RPGs  shouting ""IDF, IDF.""""I text my neighbours saying I didn't think it was IDF, they had an accent and they didn't dress appropriately - they wore the uniforms, but they didn't wear them right.""This message was also being passed around in the group.""They're also disguised as soldiers, do not answer anyone outside,"" one said.As evening approached, messages became more hopeful. The sounds people were hearing from the safe rooms were shifting. Many were hearing more Hebrew voices.They had been waiting for almost an entire day for help. In one of the first messages on the chat one member says people should not worry and that they didn't need the army - it would be all over soon. But a few minutes later, people were begging for soldiers to come.Now that help had finally arrived, residents tried to coordinate with soldiers, calling out locations for IDF troops to be sent to fight.Shortly before 18:00, a message was circulated saying the most senior forces in the army were handling the incident. ""Until now you were brave and amazing, keep staying in the safe rooms and the incident will end. Everyone is aware of the situation and information is coming through all the time.""It was around this time that Bhing and Meir were rescued from their safe room. The house around them - where the family were playing board games the night before - was now ashes. Somehow, they had survived, trapped inside a tiny room as all their belongings burned.Bhing turned as soldiers escorted them away, and took a photo on her phone of the remains.Back in the group, a message was sent at 18:08 saying: ""They're beginning a process of evacuation."" This was followed by the first messages from people saying they had been saved.But the process was slow. Many continued to plead for help long into the evening. ""Lots of bullets here too. It doesn't stop. Please they're here,"" one message just after 19:00 said.The military arrived at Dafna's brother's apartment at 20:00, telling Dafna and her husband they would be rescued within an hour.Members of the mothers' group began sharing code words the soldiers should say so residents could trust it was really them. People continued to worry that it was really Hamas trying to get into their homes.Meanwhile, the sounds of gun battles continued. They were being told it was over but as they had spent a day seeing nothing but hearing everything, they felt they could not distinguish anything or trust anybody.""They're not saying the code help us,"" one resident wrote.When the military came to Michal's home, she initially refused to open the door. One of the people from the kibbutz's emergency call-up unit called Michal's husband to assure him it really was the IDF.""They told him they're going to come back and they're going to shout. And he said tell them to shout our name and we will open,"" Michal says.The soldiers formed a circle around the family and their pet dog, as they escorted them from the kibbutz.""They told us 'we're going to go quiet and at some point you've got to cover your kids' eyes because there are a lot of bodies outside'.""So we walked, with the dog and he was really, really quiet. It took us I think 15 minutes to get outside of the kibbutz where they gathered all the people. The soldiers came to each family like this, so it took a lot of time.""She covered her children's eyes,  but Michal kept hers open.""I wanted to look. I saw bodies. My husband said he saw bodies of people from the kibbutz, but I saw bodies of terrorists,"" she says.Others couldn't bear seeing the remains of their community. ""I was looking down,"" says Shir. ""I think this saved my soul.""As they waited to be taken away, a gunman opened fire nearby. It wasn't completely over.The residents were brought on army trucks to a nearby town, before being moved on to a hotel at the Dead Sea.Dafna, who had first seen the military at 20:00, wasn't rescued until after 01:00. She had spent the past 19 hours in such a heightened state of stress and horror that she had not worried too much about her brother. Later, she learned that he had died.He was not the only one.One woman who has been calling for help the entire day after Hamas broke into her house sent a flurry of posts around 17:00. They began with a haunting, whispered voice note: ""I need help.""Others told her to hang in there.At 18:00, she posted again.""We must be evacuated,"" she said.These were the last messages from her that the BBC saw on the WhatsApp chat. Her friends say she is either dead or kidnapped.They look back to life before that first message - ""God forbid"" - to a time where their community was what they call a paradise. They describe a beautiful landscape, a community of mothers and friends that relied on each other and looked out for their neighbours.Surviving residents say they are drawing strength from their broken community - but cannot forget those who have been lost.""They are our friends, they are our family, they are everything to us,"" Golan says.""We know them. They have been part of our lives since we were born and we want them back.""The residents had built a community in kibbutz Be'eri over decades. To them, it felt unbreakable. Now, many do not know where to go and what to do.""I don't know if we'll even have a home to go to after this,"" Dafna says.""We were living in an illusion that we were safe.""Translation by Shaina Oppenheimer, Jonathan Beck, Liora Schurr, Jonathan Shamir, and othersDesign and visualisation by Tural Ahmedzade and Joy RoxasVerification by BBC Verify team: Merlyn Thomas, Josh Cheetham, Jake Horton, Paul Myers, Shayan Sardarizadeh and Paul BrownEdited by: Samuel Horti© 2023 BBC.

BBC,10-Oct,"Time now for a look at the morning papers and the conflict between Israel and Hamas features on all the front pages. ""Hell on Earth,"" says the Metro, which features a photo of a young girl in the aftermath of an Israeli air strike on Gaza, with crumpled buildings and an upturned car.The Daily Express uses a one-word headline, ""Bloodbath"", with an image of a crowd gathered around a large hole in the ground in Gaza. ""Pray for the innocents,"" says the front page of the Daily Mirror, next to photos of a crying child in Israel and an injured and bloodstained toddler in Gaza.The front page of the Times features a photo of the Kedem family, two parents and three young children, who were killed in a panic room at their kibbutz, less than a mile and a half from Gaza. The Sun's front page shows a large black cloud rising over the buildings of Gaza with the headline ""only the beginning"".The Daily Telegraph reports on a conversation between Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden, in which Netanyahu is quoted as saying, of a possible ground invasion of Gaza: ""We have to go in. We can't negotiate now.""The author and historian Michael Burleigh writes in the i that he believes Iran probably greenlit the Hamas assault on Israel because it would endanger the deal being negotiated between Israel and Saudi Arabia.Mr Burleigh writes: ""The likely draconian Israeli response will make it very unwise for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to commit to anything with Israel that will antagonise Saudi public opinion.""Here, the i reports that the Labour Party has urged people not to take part in protests to boycott Israel outside the party's conference in Liverpool. It quotes an unnamed shadow cabinet minister as saying ""a few years ago people were waving Palestinian flags in the conference hall. That's gone now"".Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.The Times suggests Sir Kier Starmer will use his leader's speech later to pledge to build Georgian-style townhouses in urban areas. He will also promise to construct new towns, echoing the post-war Labour government's construction of Milton Keynes and Crawley, as well as committing to half of all homes being built on what will be termed ""grey belt"" land, scrubland and car parks, to become affordable housing.Monday's speech by the shadow chancellor is digested by many of the papers. The Daily Mail says Rachel Reeves ""appeared to make an audacious grab for Margaret Thatcher's mantle of economic competence"". The Guardian's John Crace writes: ""It's probably the first time a Labour conference has ever stood up to applaud fiscal responsibility. But we live in strange times.""Finally, the Daily Mail reports on research from Oxford and Stanford universities which reveals people have an inconsistent use of pronouns when it comes to speaking about Amazon's voice assistant Alexa. They describe the device as ""she"" and ""her"" when talking about the voice assistant, but ""it"" in the context of its manufacturer, the technology giant, Amazon.Professor Ekaterina Herzog, of Oxford University, believes this represents an attempt to separate the device, which is perceived as trustworthy even though it collects a large amount of personal information, from its company which is seen as less favourably viewed.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,13-Oct,"Israel says it is striking parts of a secret labyrinth of tunnels built underneath the Gaza Strip by Hamas, as it continues to retaliate for the Palestinian Islamist militant group's unprecedented cross-border attack on Saturday.""Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas. We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built,"" an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said in a video on Thursday.""These aren't bunkers for Gazan civilians. It's only for Hamas and other terrorists so that they can continue to fire rockets at Israel, to plan operations, to launch terrorists into Israel,"" they claimed.It is very difficult to assess the size of the network, which Israel has dubbed the ""Gaza Metro"" because it is believed to stretch beneath a territory that is only 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.Following a conflict in 2021, the IDF said it had destroyed more than 100km of tunnels in air strikes. Hamas meanwhile claimed that its tunnels stretched 500km and that only 5% were hit. To put those figures into perspective, the London Underground is 400km long and is mostly above ground.Tunnel construction began in Gaza before Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005.But it was ramped up after Hamas took control of the Strip two years later, which prompted Israel and Egypt to begin restricting the movement of goods and people in and out for security reasons.At its peak, almost 2,500 tunnels running underneath the Egyptian border were used to smuggle in commercial goods, fuel and weapons by Hamas and other militant groups.The smuggling became less important to Gaza after 2010, when Israel began allowing more goods to be imported through its crossings. Egypt later shut the smuggling down by flooding or destroying the tunnels.Hamas and other factions also started digging tunnels to attack Israeli forces.In 2006, militants used one underneath the border with Israel to kill two Israeli soldiers and seize a third, Gilad Shalit, who they held captive for five years.In 2013, the IDF discovered a 1.6km-long, 18m-deep tunnel lined with a concrete roof and walls leading from the Strip to land near an Israeli kibbutz after residents heard strange sounds.The following year, Israel cited the need to eradicate the threat of attacks by militants using such ""terror tunnels"" under the frontier for a major air and ground offensive in Gaza.The IDF said its forces destroyed more than 30 tunnels during the war. But a group of militants were also able to use one to mount an attack in which four Israeli soldiers were killed.""The cross-border tunnels tend to be rudimentary, meaning they have barely any fortification. They are dug for a one-time purpose - invading Israeli territory,"" says Dr Daphné Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare who teaches at Reichman University in Israel.""The tunnels inside Gaza are different because Hamas is using them on a regular basis. They are probably more comfortable to be in for longer periods of time. They are definitely equipped for a longer, sustained presence.""""The leaders are hiding there, they have command-and-control centres, they use them for transport and lines of communication. They are equipped with electricity, lighting and rail tracks. You can move around more and stand.""She says Hamas appears to have ""perfected the art"" of tunnel building and warfare in recent years, having learned a huge amount by observing the tactics of Syrian rebel fighters in Aleppo and jihadist militants from the Islamic State (IS) group in Mosul.This video can not be playedNews report, February 2015: Quentin Sommerville was blindfolded before gaining access to a Palestinian Islamic Jihad tunnelThe tunnels inside Gaza are believed to be as much as 30m (100ft) below the surface and have entrances located on the bottom floors of houses, mosques, schools and other public buildings to allow militants to evade detection.Building the network has also come at a cost to the local population. The IDF has accused Hamas of diverting millions of dollars given to Gaza in aid to pay for the tunnels as well as tens of thousands of tons of cement intended for rebuilding homes destroyed in previous wars.It is possible that a cross-border tunnel was used by Hamas militants during last weekend's attacks in Israel, in which at least 1,300 people were killed, most of them civilians, and more than 150 others were taken as hostages. There were reports that a tunnel exit was discovered near the kibbutz of Kfar Aza, where dozens of civilians were massacred.If that is confirmed, the tunnel would have been built beneath the underground concrete barrier studded with sophisticated anti-tunnel detection sensors which Israel finished installing at the end of 2021.Dr Richemond-Barak says it would be a shock, but stresses that no tunnel detection system is fool-proof. ""This is why tunnels have been used for time immemorial in war, because is there no way to prevent them.""She also cautions that it is unrealistic for the Israeli establishment and general public to believe it will be possible for the IDF to destroy Hamas's entire network of tunnels in Gaza, as hundreds of thousands of troops mass nearby for a possible ground operation.""There will be parts of the network where civilians, for whatever reason, will not evacuate... Some parts of the underground network are unknown. And for some of them the collateral damage will be too high.""Destroying the tunnels will also lead to a significant loss of life - among Israeli forces on the ground, Palestinian civilians and the hostages, she warns.More than 1,500 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them civilians, have already been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes since Saturday.""Hamas is very good at using human shields. Once a strike is imminent and they know it, they will put innocent civilians on top of buildings. That has forced Israel to cancel strikes many times,"" Dr Richemond-Barak says.""Having mastered the technique, Hamas could easily use it in the context of the tunnels and simply put Israeli, American and other hostages inside them.""During the 2021 conflict, a series of devastating air strikes in Gaza City brought three residential buildings crashing to the ground, killing 42 people. The IDF said it targeted underground tunnels, but that when they collapsed the building's foundations collapsed too.The tunnel network will also negate the advantages that the IDF has in terms of technology and intelligence, magnify the difficulties of urban warfare, and pose a lethal threat to Israeli troops, according to Dr Richemond-Barak.""First of all, Hamas has had plenty of time to booby-trap the entire network,"" she says. ""They could just let the soldiers enter into the tunnel network and then eventually blow the whole thing up.""""They could kidnap [the soldiers in surprise attacks]. And then you have all the other risks - running out of oxygen, fighting the enemy in one-on-one combat, and rescuing wounded soldiers becomes virtually impossible.""She adds: ""Even if you don't go inside the tunnel, to secure an area where you suspect that tunnels might be present is very different from just securing an area in general. Here, you have to secure something that is invisible.""The Israeli forces will, however, have some ways to mitigate the risks.According to Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group security consultancy, these might include sending drones and unmanned vehicles into tunnels to map them and identify booby traps before soldiers clear them.Warplanes could also drop ""bunker busting"" bombs, which penetrate deep into the ground before detonating. However, they would pose a risk of collateral damage due to the dense urban terrain.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,9-Oct,"Questions about the involvement of Israel's arch-enemy Iran are already being asked in the wake of the deadly assault by Hamas on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip.A report in the Wall Street Journal quotes unnamed members of Hamas and the Lebanese guerrilla movement Hezbollah as saying that Iran gave the go-ahead for the attack a week ago.But a senior defence official in Washington later said that the US had ""no information at this time"" to corroborate specific allegations of an Iranian role in the attacks.Regardless, the stakes on the truth of this are high. If it emerged that Iran was behind the attacks, it could widen the conflict into a regional confrontation.So while Iran's leaders have celebrated and praised the attacks, they have been quick to deny involvement.""The accusations linked to an Iranian role… are based on political reasons,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry said.Iran did not intervene ""in the decision-making of other countries"", a spokesman added.But none of this means Iran wasn't involved.The US says it had ""not yet"" seen evidence Iran was behind the attacks. However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that ""there is certainly a long relationship"".Tehran has been one of Hamas' main sponsors for many years, providing it with financial assistance and vast quantities of weaponry, including rockets.Israel has spent years trying to disrupt Iran's supply routes to Gaza, which involve Sudan, Yemen, ships in the Red Sea and Bedouin smugglers in the lawless Sinai Peninsula.As one of Israel's most implacable foes, Iran clearly has a vested interest in seeing the Jewish state suffer.""I would say that it's not too much to assume that Iran is involved,"" Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, told the BBC.""This is the response of Iran to reports that a peace treaty is going to happen between Israel and Saudi Arabia.""But Mr Tomer said he found the suggestion that Iran actually ordered Saturday's attack ""a little bit cumbersome"".""Yes, it's true that Iran is the number one provider of equipment to Hamas,"" he said, ""and that they were training them in Syria and even, reportedly, in Iran.""Israel, he said, had been watching the movement of Hamas officials in recent months.""We have seen people like Saleh al-Arouri (head of the organisation's military wing) and other Hamas leaders flying back and forth between Lebanon and Iran, holding meetings, including with [Supreme Leader Ayatollah] Khamenei himself.""But this ""intimate relationship"" was not enough, Mr Tomer said, to explain the timing of the attack.""Hamas was very much tuned to the inner conflict in Israel,"" he said.""Iran sustains and supports every logistic and military aspect, but I think the decision was at least 75% an independent decision by the Hamas leadership.""Raz Zimmt, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv University, agrees.""This is a Palestinian story,"" he posted on social media today.According to the Wall Street Journal, Iran gave the green light for the attack at a meeting in Beirut last Monday.Unnamed Hamas and Hezbollah sources told the newspaper that officers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had worked alongside Hamas since August to put together Saturday's complex air, land and sea operation.Videos of the Hamas attack pointed to a level of sophistication far beyond the organisation's mostly crude attempts in the past to breach Israel's security fence surrounding the Gaza Strip.The simultaneous use of rockets, drones, vehicles and powered hang-gliders suggested that the operation's planners had studied other recent examples of hybrid warfare, perhaps including Ukraine.But the decision to attack, Mr Raz said, was taken ""by Hamas, based on its own interests, arising from the Palestinian reality"".""Did Hamas use Iranian aid? Definitely, yes. Did Iran have an interest in this action? Yes. Does Hamas need Iranian permission to operate? No.""Hamas has been developing its elite units for several years, says Haim Tomer, the former Mossad official.""But still they performed above their former level,"" he said.Israeli officials are now looking north and south as they figure out what happens next and whether Iran's involvement could become more overt.Iran's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, has already launched two small-scale attacks into the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. The Israeli military says it has used helicopters to hit targets inside Lebanon.""The Hamas operation is a reality-changing event in the Middle East that may oblige Iran to move from the phase of ongoing support and co-ordination to a more direct involvement, especially if the Israeli response poses a significant challenge to Hamas,"" Mr Raz said.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,9-Oct,"Oil prices have jumped on concerns that the situation in Israel and Gaza could disrupt output from the Middle East.Brent crude, the international benchmark, climbed by $2.25 a barrel to $86.83, while US prices also rose.Israel and Palestinian territories are not oil producers but the Middle Eastern region accounts for almost a third of global supply.Hamas's assault on Israel was the biggest escalation between the two sides for decades.Western nations condemned the attacks. A spokesperson for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, told the BBC that the group had direct backing for the move from Iran - one of the world's largest oil producers.Iran denied involvement in the assault at a UN Security Council meeting in New York on Sunday, Reuters reported. But Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has expressed support for the attack.On Monday, Israel ordered US oil giant Chevron to pause production at the Tamar natural gas field off the country's northern coast, which is within range of rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.The country's energy ministry, which has closed the field during previous periods of unrest, said there was enough fuel from other sources to meet Israel's energy needs.Israel's largest offshore gas field, Leviathan, continues to operate as normal, Chevron said.Energy analyst Saul Kavonic told the BBC that global oil prices have risen ""due to the prospect of a wider conflagration that could spread to nearby major oil-producing nations such as Iran and Saudi Arabia"".On Monday morning, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, was up $2.50 a barrel at $85.30.""If the conflict envelops Iran, which has been accused of supporting the Hamas attacks, up to 3% of global oil supply is at risk,"" Mr Kavonic added.Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC's Today programme that Iran had been increasing oil production over the course of this year despite US sanctions.""The US seems to have turned a blind eye to a steady increase in Iranian production, that... is going to be more difficult for the US to ignore going forward from here,"" she said.Overall, Ms Bain said Capital Economics expected demand for oil to exceed supply in the final three months of the year and ""that should support higher prices"".Mr Kavonic said that about a fifth of global supply would be ""held hostage"" if passage through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil trading route is disrupted.The Strait of Hormuz is crucial for the main oil exporters in the Gulf region, whose economies are built around oil and gas production.Uncertainty over how events could develop in the coming days may also drive investments into US Treasury bonds and the dollar, which investors traditionally buy at times of crisis, said James Cheo from HSBC bank.On Monday, Israel's central bank said it would sell up to $30bn of foreign currency in a bid to calm markets and support the country's own currency, the shekel, which has fallen sharply.""At this stage, there is a bit of nervousness. [Investors] want to see a little more clarity, particularly on economic data and on developments associated with geopolitical uncertainty,"" added Mr Cheo.Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year.They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market.Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer, said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day in July.Other members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices.Opec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,12-Oct,"Some UK tourists are spending thousands of pounds on flights to try to get out of Israel, describing the situation as ""horrendous"".Many commercial carriers have suspended flights after Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli air strikes.A number of countries, including France and Germany, have chartered flights to evacuate their citizens.On Thursday afternoon the UK government said it too would arrange flights to get British nationals out of Israel.The first flight is due to depart from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv later, with vulnerable British nationals prioritised for these flights.Although arranged by the Foreign Office, they are commercial services. Each passenger will be charged £300.The UK had previously said it would not arrange evacuation flights because commercial routes were still available, and was only flying out the families of British diplomats working in Israel.Since Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Saturday, many international airlines have suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv, and securing flight bookings has become increasingly difficult.Lisa Tsang and her cousin Deborah arrived in Tel Aviv for an organised tour on Saturday, after being told by their airline that it was safe to travel.They were booked to stay at a hotel close to the British Embassy, but as they got off the plane sirens were sounding, and they had to shelter as soon as they got to the hotel.Lisa's husband Mike tried to organise return travel from the UK. He ended up spending about £5,000 on flights, with about £1,500 of that for the flights Lisa and Deborah eventually took.Airlines took the money but did not advise customers the flights had been cancelled, Lisa said, describing the flight situation as ""horrendous"".""It will be two to three weeks for a refund,"" she said. ""This is shocking. I am fortunate [Mike] is in a position to keep booking endless flights.""Some tickets are thousands of pounds. How is this justifiable?""Lisa and Deborah eventually managed to get back to Gateshead on Thursday morning after getting a flight from Israel to Egypt, and then a separate flight to Manchester.""I'm just dazed,"" said Lisa. ""It was a dangerous situation.""Ben Hardcastle, 31, flew to Tel Aviv from Luton on Saturday for a holiday with his friend Shannon Burke.When the pair landed, they heard Israel was at war.He said that he thought that might lead to them being evacuated, along with other British nationals.On their first night they heard sirens and had to find shelter in a stairwell of a hotel.""It was quite traumatising be down there,"" he said.""We had to stay down there 10 minutes every time the alarm went off. It's just one of those situations that you think you will never be in.""After being unable to contact the British embassy in Tel Aviv, and being told by a consulate in London that Tel Aviv was ""a safe place to be"", the pair decided to go to the airport to try to get home.After booking four flights, none of which took off, and seeing prices soar to £1,500 per person, Ben managed to get a flight to Istanbul, which he said was a ""nerve-wracking experience"".They have since managed to travel to Antalya and are hoping to get back to Luton on Monday.""I know money is trivial in this situation but we have spent thousands on cancelled flights. We are lucky we have the means to do so.""Ben, who lives near Coventry and Birmingham, said he had also seen the news that there had been a huge fire in Luton airport's car park, and he was not sure if his car was affected.""You cannot make it up,"" he added. ""[But] it does not matter. I just feel for the people that have been left there [in Tel Aviv].""It's absolutely shocking. It's incomprehensible.""The only airline currently running direct flights to the UK is Israeli carrier El Al.Airlines that have suspended commercial flights to and from Tel Aviv due to security concerns include British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, EasyJet, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates.A number of countries have been chartering flights to evacuate citizens, including Australia, Canada, Demark, Italy, Norway, Spain and Switzerland.The UK government has not provided an estimate on how many UK citizens are in Israel.However, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has advised people to register their presence to share updates ""including information to support you to leave the country"".The government department advises against all but essential travel to Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Gaza and other parts of the region.Travel insurance may not be valid if people travel against FCDO advice.The British embassy in Tel Aviv will remain open and continue to provide consular services to those who need help, the FCDO said.© 2023 BBC.

""I think the question was at what level.""An Egyptian intelligence official told the Associated Press news agency this week that Cairo had repeatedly warned the Israelis ""something big"" was being planned from Gaza.""We have warned them an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big. But they underestimated such warnings,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The Cairo official said Israeli officials had played down the threat from Gaza, instead focusing on the West Bank.Sir Alex Younger, who served as chief of the UK's foreign intelligence agency between 2014 and 2020, said Hamas fighters were able to carry out their attack on 7 October due to ""institutional complacency"" in Israel.He told BBC Radio 4's Today Podcast there may have been an assumption by Israel that Hamas was not interested in a new conflict, so any information that contradicted that was discounted.""It is my assumption - though I'm not on the inside - that there would be data breaking through that could have been interpreted differently and certainly would be with hindsight,"" he said.He added that complacency could have been compounded by an over-reliance on technological means to monitor Gaza, leading to a false sense of security.According to the Financial Times, quoting two unnamed officials familiar with the matter, there was no hard intelligence of a specific attack.On Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu described any suggestion that Israel had received a specific warning in advance of the deadly incursion as ""totally fake news"".This video can not be playedWatch: Hiding at home, blinded and choked by dust - a video diary from GazaEgypt - which controls who crosses its border with Gaza - often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas.More than 1,500 militants stormed through the Gaza security barrier in a co-ordinated land, air and sea attack on Saturday.The death toll in Israel from the Hamas attacks has reached 1,200.

BBC,4 days ago,"Abed Wadi was getting dressed for the funeral when the message arrived.It was an image, forwarded to him by a friend, of a group of masked men posing with axes, a petrol canister, and a chainsaw, with text printed on the image in Hebrew and Arabic.""To all the rats in the sewers of Qusra village, we are waiting for you and we will not mourn you,"" the text said.""The day of revenge is coming.""Qusra was Wadi's village, in the northern part of the West Bank near Nablus. The funeral that day was for four Palestinians from the village. Three had been killed the previous day - Wednesday 11 October - after Israeli settlers entered Qusra and attacked a Palestinian family home.The fourth was shot dead in clashes with Israeli soldiers that followed.The following day, the Qusra villagers were preparing to set out for a hospital half an hour away and return with the bodies of the dead. To do so, they would need to travel across land that is dotted with Israeli settlements, where the risk of violence, high even in ordinary times, has risen dramatically in the two weeks since the Hamas attack that launched a war with Israel.Wadi put his phone down and continued getting dressed. There were four men in refrigerators in the hospital who needed to be brought home. He was not going to be deterred by a threat, he said. He had heard too many.There was no way for Wadi to know that, in a few hours' time, hardline Israeli settlers would confront the funeral procession and his own brother and young nephew would be shot dead.""If we had delayed one or even two days, what good would it have done?"" Wadi said, sitting in the shaded courtyard of his family home in Qusra.""Do you think that the settlers would have left this place on the second day?""According to the UN's humanitarian office, the week that followed Hamas's murderous attack was the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since it began reporting fatalities in 2005, with at least 75 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military or settlers, and incidents of settler violence up from an average of three a day to eight.In one raid on a Palestinian refugee camp, and a rare air strike in the region, on Thursday 12th, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Palestinian officials said, and Israeli police said one officer was killed.There was ""a real risk"" of the occupied territory ""spiralling out of control"", the UN said this week.Palestinian residents of the West Bank say that while the world's attention is drawn to the unfolding disaster in Gaza, Israeli settlers are taking advantage by entering villages and expelling, and even killing, Palestinian civilians.In at least three cases, according to video footage or eyewitness testimony from villagers, the settlers have been wearing military uniforms or accompanied by the Israeli military in their attacks.The first three men who died in Qusra had gone to defend a family in a house on the outskirts of the village, after settlers approached the house and began throwing rocks at it, several residents told the BBC.They say the settlers then opened fire at the Palestinian neighbours who came to assist, killing two teenagers and a young man - Hasan Abu Sorour, 16, Obayda Abu Sorour, 17, and Musab Abu Reda, 25 - and gravely wounding several others. Moath Odeh, aged 21, was killed later in clashes with soldiers.Among the wounded were a father and his six-year-old daughter, who lived at the house, who were shot in the face and in the abdomen respectively, according to two people who received the dead and wounded at a nearby medical clinic.One of those assisting at the clinic was Amer Odeh, a cousin of two of the victims. It fell to Amer to call Said Odeh, the father of 17-year-old Obayda.""I told him, your son is lightly injured,"" Amer said, in an interview alongside Said in Qusra on Tuesday. ""I could not give him this shock over the phone.""Said rushed to the medical centre. ""They told me that my son was injured but there was no way for me to see him at that moment,"" he recalled, his eyes shiny with tears.""I told them I wanted to see my son now, and I entered that room and I saw that by the grace of God he had been martyred.""The following day was set to be the funeral for the four victims. Abed Wadi put the image of the masked men with axes and chainsaws out of his mind and joined the funeral convoy bringing the bodies back from the hospital to Qusra.As the cars and ambulances made their way along the Nablus-Ramallah road, the convoy was ambushed by hardline Israeli settlers. In the clash that followed, according to video footage and eyewitness testimony, settlers pelted the convoy with stones, some members of the funeral convoy threw stones back, and the Israeli settlers and soldiers responded with live fire.In the ""chaos and heavy, random gunfire,"" Abed Wadi lost track of his brother, Ibrahim, a 63-year-old local politician with the Fatah Movement, and Ibrahim's son Ahmed, a 24-year-old law student. Video footage of part of the confrontation appears to show Ahmed and others running away from the gunfire, before Ahmed is cut down by bullets on the road.""They told me my nephew was shot twice in his stomach and once in his neck, and my brother was shot in his waist, towards his heart,"" Wadi said.""There were no weapons in our funeral convoy,"" he said. ""Usually we would fly the Palestinian flag from the cars but we did not even fly our flag, because of the fear.""Residents in Qusra told the BBC this week that fear had permeated the village. Last weekend was the beginning of olive season in the area, but residents who depend on the harvest for their income said they would not go to the groves on the outskirts of the village for fear of settlers shooting.There had already been a significant increase in violence by Israeli settlers this year, even before the Hamas attack, according to UN data, with more than 100 incidents reported each month and about 400 people driven from their land between January and August.Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem told the BBC that since the attack, it had documented ""a concerted and organised effort by settlers to use the fact that the entire international and local attention is focused on Gaza and the north of Israel to try to seize land in the West Bank"".Partial data compiled by B'Tselem, covering the first six days after the Hamas attack, recorded at least 46 separate incidents in which it said settlers threatened, physically attacked or damaged the property of Palestinians in the West Bank.""A lot of shepherding families and communities have fled because they were threatened in the past week by settlers,"" said Roy Yellin, a spokesman for B'Tselem. ""Settlers have been giving residents a deadline to leave and telling them if they don't they will be harmed. And some villages have been totally emptied out.""One of those villages was Wadi al-Siq, near Ramallah, previously home to a Palestinian Bedouin community of about 200. ""For months we have been facing harassment and attacks from settlers day and night, but since the start of the war the attacks increased,"" said Abdul Rahman Kaabna, 48, a farmer from Wadi al-Siq.On 9 October, a group of approximately 60 settlers, many dressed in military uniforms, attacked the community, according to three now-exiled residents. ""They attacked us with weapons and terrified everyone,"" Kaabna said. ""Then they gave us one hour to go out with our sheep and threatened us to death if we didn't leave.""The residents walked more than 10km (6.2 miles) to escape, said another resident, Ali Arara, 35. ""The settlers stole everything from our homes,"" he said. ""My daughter was terrified. They beat us and left us with nothing.""According to B'Tselem and Yesh Din, another Israeli human rights group which monitors West Bank violence, the intimidation and forced displacement reported in Wadi al-Siq has been repeated in communities across the territory since 7 October.In one of the most shocking incidents caught on film in the past week, an Israeli settler entered a Palestinian village called Al-Tuwani near Hebron and shot an unarmed Palestinian resident in the stomach at point blank range, while an Israeli soldier appeared to look on.The incident began when two armed settlers, accompanied by a soldier, attacked a home on the outskirts of the village, according to three residents including the homeowner.""Three Israelis came to my house, they were armed, and one was wearing the uniform of the army,"" said Musab Rabai, 36.""One of the settlers came into the house, pushed me and beat me on the head with the gun and told me he was going to shoot me.""Neighbours responded to Rabai's shouts for help, he said. Among them was Zakriha Adra, a father of four. Video footage filmed by Adra's cousin, Basel, shows the settler who allegedly beat Rabai and the Israeli soldier standing a short distance away from the group of Palestinian neighbours. The armed settler then suddenly approaches Adra, strikes him with his rifle and shoots him in the stomach from just a few feet away.Throughout the encounter, Adra appears to be holding his arms by his sides in a non-threatening manner.This video can not be playedZakriha Adra was wounded by a shot to his stomach at close range. Video courtesy of B'TselemAccording to the family, Adra is now in hospital in critical condition. ""He survived but the bullet has done a lot of damage inside his stomach,"" said Basel, his cousin.Musab Rabai, whose house was attacked, said the shooting had been a culmination of days of threatening behaviour and property destruction by the settlers.""Since Saturday they have been standing around the village armed with guns and using a bulldozer to destroy trees,"" he said. ""The men here in the village have been sleeping in shifts, only a few hours each, so there is always someone awake in case the settlers attack.""The BBC asked the Yesha Council, the umbrella organisation for the settlers in the West Bank and elsewhere, to comment for this story but they declined. Moti Yogev, the acting head of the Binyamin Council, which also represents settlers in the region, said that violent settlers ""belonged to the fringes"" of the settler community. ""If they do exist, they should be dealt with like any other criminal,"" he said.The Israeli military and Israeli police force did not respond to multiple requests for comment.""The most tragic thing is that the violence by these extreme settlers does not produce any response from the Israeli military,"" said Dov Khenin, a former Israeli politician turned peace activist. ""And the violence has its own purpose, to get rid of these small Palestinian communities, to eject them from their homes.""The fear for many Palestinians now is that the situation in the West Bank will only get worse. Israel's National Security Minister, Itar Ben Gvir, announced last week that the government would purchase 10,000 rifles to arm Israeli civilians, including those in West Bank settlements - a move that threatens to further blur the lines between armed settlers and members of the military in the occupied territory.In Qusra, Abed Wadi said he had heard the news about the 10,000 rifles. He shook his head. ""It won't change anything for the people of Qusra,"" he said.Wadi was sitting in his courtyard, surrounded by posters bearing the image of his brother, his nephew, and the four other men from the village who were killed last week.""We have always seen the rifle in the hands of the settlers, they have been shooting at us for a long time,"" he said.But something had changed, he said. It seemed as though the settlers had become more aggressive, more radical. ""Farm houses are being burned, olive trees cut down, cars broken into, land is being stolen,"" Wadi said.""And this is just our village.

BBC,12-Oct,"This video can not be playedNadia El-Nakla tells of her fears for the future of her family trapped in GazaThe wife of Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf said her parents, who have been trapped in Gaza since the Hamas attack on Israel, are ""terrified"" about what might happen next.Nadia El-Nakla also told BBC News some relatives have had their homes destroyed in missile strikes.Elizabeth El-Nakla and Maged El-Nakla, who live in Dundee, travelled to Gaza last week to see a sick relative.Days into their trip Hamas killed 1,200 people, Israeli officials say.Palestinian health officials say 1,200 people have died in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza as the death toll continues to rise in the conflict.On Tuesday Mr Yousaf called for the creation of a humanitarian corridor in and out of locked-down Gaza.Mr and Mrs El-Nakla were visiting their son - a father-of-four - and Mr El-Nakla's 92-year-old mother, who is ill.Ms El-Nakla said: ""They are now caught up in a war situation.""My mother says that there is continual bombardment from land, sea and air.""She said her mother had not slept since Monday and feels as if ""every part of her body is shaking"".The family had hoped to escape on Tuesday but the Rafah border, between Gaza and Egypt, was bombed and all Israeli crossings have been shut.Speaking in Bute House, the first minister's official residence in Edinburgh, Ms El-Nakla said: ""They are just terrified, absolutely terrified, about what is to come and what is happening right now as we speak.""The Dundee City councillor said she was troubled by the language emanating from the conflict, especially claims Gaza would be ""obliterated"" in response to the Hamas attacks.She added: ""It puts the complete fear into me that I am never going to see them again.""Since the air strikes started, her aunt and cousin have had their homes reduced to rubble.Ms El-Nakla spoke to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on Wednesday but at the moment there is no way out.Should that change, she believes her parents would face an ""impossible decision"" as her other relatives do not have UK passports.Ms El-Nakla said: ""At times my arms feel like lead and it feels like I am just living in a nightmare for them. So I can't understand how they feel.""The mother-of-two has a number of scenarios going through her head and has warned against any cuts to aid.She said: ""This needs to be a time when medical resources, food, water, basic human needs are met. That is international law. It is really vital.""That's my fear. First is they die. Second is they are starving. Three is the house is put to rubble and they are in camps.""That is really scary.""Ms El-Nakla is also worried about the impact on her brother's young children, especially her eight-week-old nephew.She added: ""Every time the bombs go off his arms just flail in fear. I fear that his little heart can't take that continual bombardment.""Earlier, her mother recorded a moving 40-second video clip from the city of Deir al-Balah in which she detailed the family's plight.Close to tears, she said: ""We have no electricity. We have no water. The food we do have, which is little, will not last because there is no electricity and it will spoil.""I have four grandchildren in this home - a two-month-old baby, a four-year-old and, today, two nine-year-old twins. Their birthday.""I ask the world to help the Palestinians.""Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, international spokesman of the Israel Defense Forces, said that Gaza ""was not a good place to be"" for the family and added that as far as he knew it was not possible for them to leave just now.He told BBC Scotland News: ""I think this will be a very long war, our military aim is to strip Hamas of all its military capability.""All movement into and out of Gaza is controlled by the Israeli authorities, except the pedestrian-only Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai peninsula, which is controlled by the Egyptian authorities.This has come under bombardment from Israel in recent days and, according to the BBC's Egypt correspondent Sally Nabil, Egyptians are concerned about being dragged into the conflict.Speaking on the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, she said: ""There might be a possibility that Egypt will be asked to open the borders for Gaza residents to walk into the Sinai peninsula.""That would put Egypt in a very tight position because at that point it will be one of the countries on the front line and Egyptians do not want that.""We are not just talking about official circles here but even the people. They don't want to be a part of the confrontation.""There is this dilemma of whether or not to open the borders. They want to open the borders just to send in humanitarian aid to Gaza but they don't want the residents of Gaza to move into Sinai.""Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf has urged the foreign secretary to call for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza.In a letter to James Cleverly, the first minister urged him to use the positive relationship between the UK and Israel to push for civilians in Gaza to be allowed to leave through the Rafah border.He wrote: ""Too many innocent people have already lost their lives as a consequence of these completely unjustifiable and illegitimate attacks by Hamas.""However, innocent men, women and children cannot, and should not, pay the price for the actions of a terrorist group.""The Glasgow Jewish community has held a ""silent and peaceful"" vigil for the victims in Israel on the steps of the Royal Concert Hall.Among those remembered was grandfather Bernard Cowan, who was confirmed on Monday as the first Scottish victim of the Hamas assault on Israel.Mr Cowan grew up in the Glasgow area and settled in Israel, near the Gaza border, with his wife and three children.On Wednesday an official UK source told the BBC 17 British nationals, including children, are dead or missing in Israel.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,12-Oct,"This video can not be playedWatch: My daughter’s final moments as Hamas invaded her homeAt least 22 American citizens are confirmed to have died after Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel, the US state department has said.At least another 17 Americans are missing, the White House confirmed.It is unclear how many of those may been taken captive by the Palestinian militant group.The death toll from the attack in Israel has reached 1,200. More than 1,100 people have died in Israeli air strikes on Gaza.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the updated figure on Wednesday, posting on X: ""We join families in Israel, in the US, and around the world mourning the loss of loved ones killed in Hamas's heinous attacks.""We continue efforts to secure the release of those hostages, and the US remains steadfast and unwavering in our support for Israel,"" he wrote.White House spokesman John Kirby warned the numbers could rise: ""I think we all need to steel ourselves for the very distinct possibility that these numbers will keep increasing, and that we may in fact, find out that more Americans are part of the hostage pool,"" he said.Speaking at a roundtable discussion with Jewish leaders on Thursday, President Biden accused Hamas of mounting a ""campaign of pure cruelty"" and said it was among the darkest days for the Jewish community since the Holocaust.Regarding the ongoing hostage situation, he told the audience that if he shared all the details of efforts to free Americans he ""wouldn't be able to get them home"".A number of Palestinian-Americans are also reported to be stuck in Gaza, though it is unclear if any of them have been injured in the bombardment.The US Embassy in Jerusalem said in a security alert on Monday: ""US citizens in Gaza who wish to leave and can do so safely are advised to check the status of the Rafah Crossing into Egypt.""The state department increased its travel alert warning level on Wednesday, advising Americans to reconsider any plans to visit Israel and the West Bank.Among the missing Americans is 23-year-old American-Israeli Hersh Golberg-Polin, who was at a music festival in the desert when it was stormed by militants.His parents told the Jerusalem Post they received two messages from him, reading ""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry"".""We just want him safe,"" Jonathan Polin, his father, said.Another US citizen living in Israel, Abbey Onn, told the BBC's partner CBS that five members of her family, including a 12-year-old boy, were taken hostage.On Saturday, she received a WhatsApp message from her family that Hamas fighters were in their home at Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza.Judith and Natalie Raanan, a mother and teenage daughter from Chicago, Illinois, were visiting relatives in southern Israel when the attack began.Judith's ex-husband, Natalie's father, told a local news station the pair had texted him that they were hiding in a safe room, but he had not heard from them since.A soldier with dual US-Israeli citizenship, Itay Chen, has been reported missing in action since Saturday.His father, Ruby Chen, told CBS he had sought the state department's help in finding his son, who he said had grown up in New York City.He added that it is ""a fair assumption"" his son was taken to Gaza.Mr Kirby said the US wants to get all hostages back with families, particularly the American ones, but the US does not know where the hostages are, whether they are all together or how often they are being moved.US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the US was in regular contact with the families of the missing.The identities of all the Americans killed have not yet been officially released, but some family members have been announcing the news online or speaking to local media.Ilan Troen, a professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, said his daughter Deborah Matias, 50, and her husband, Shlomi, were killed when Hamas fighters attacked their community in southern Israel.Mr Troen said his daughter died while shielding their son, Roten.""They made sure to fall on him and thereby saved his life,"" he told CBS. ""Although a bullet actually entered his abdomen, but he was saved.""Long-time Israel resident Hannah Katsman, a native of Cincinnati, Ohio, wrote on Facebook that her son Hayim Katsman was killed at his kibbutz near the border with Gaza.Mr Katsman, an academic who specialised in Israel studies, graduated from the University of Washington.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,11-Oct,"This video can not be playedWatch: Buildings in Lebanon damaged after Israel shellingIsrael says it has reinforced its northern area with thousands of extra units after trading fire with Lebanon.Its army shelled militant targets in Lebanon after two missiles were fired at an Israeli military post near the unofficial border.Three people were injured in the shelling which hit several towns and villages, Lebanese state media said.The Hezbollah movement said the missiles were a response to the killing of three of its fighters on Monday.The exchange came as Israel bombed Gaza in retaliation for Palestinian militant group Hamas' unprecedented attack.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said an anti-tank missile was fired from Lebanon towards an Israeli military post near the village of Arab al-Aramshe, which is just south of the UN-demarcated Blue Line - the unofficial border which separates Israel and Lebanon.Hezbollah said it targeted the position ""in a decisive retaliation to Zionist aggression on Monday"". It claimed that the missile caused several Israeli casualties.The IDF said that as part of its response to the attack, aircraft attacked an observation post inside Lebanon belonging to Hezbollah. Artillery also shelled the missile launch site. It did not report any casualties among its troops.Lebanon's National News Agency reported that three civilians were wounded and 10 houses were damaged by Israeli fire in the town of Marwahin. The towns of Yarin, and Dharya were also hit, it said.""We have deployed tens of thousands additional units along the northern border,"" IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said on Wednesday, referring to infantry, special forces, armoured forces, artillery, air forces and intelligence.""The message to Hezbollah is very clear. If they will try to attack, we are ready and vigilant along our border,"" he added.Israel and the US have warned Iran-backed Hezbollah, Lebanon's most powerful military force, against opening another battle front after Hamas militants from Gaza killed at least 1,200 people in an attack on southern Israel on Saturday. More than 1,000 people have been killed by Israel's retaliatory air strikes on Gaza.""Let me say again - to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't. Don't,"" US President Joe Biden said in a statement on Tuesday - seemingly reinforcing the warning.Tensions on Israel's northern frontier have soared since Hamas' bloody incursion.Three Israeli soldiers were killed in a confrontation with gunmen from Palestinian Islamic Jihad who infiltrated Israeli territory from Lebanon on Monday. Two of the Palestinian militants were also killed in the incident.The three Hezbollah militants were killed later on Monday, as Israeli forces attacked its positions in Lebanon in response to mortar fire.On Tuesday, Hezbollah said its fighters fired an anti-tank guided missile at an Israeli military vehicle in the Avivim area.The military said it caused no casualties and that a helicopter attacked one of the group's observation posts in response.Hamas also claimed that its fighters in Lebanon had fired rockets towards Israel's western Galilee region.The rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the Israeli military, which retaliated by shelling another two Hezbollah observation posts.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,8-Oct,"This video can not be playedWatch: A day of violence and fearIsrael's military has warned that Hamas militants from Gaza are still fighting inside Israel after they infiltrated southern communities and left a reported 300 people dead.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israelis they are going into a ""long and difficult war"".Hundreds of gunmen burst into southern Israel, killing soldiers and civilians, and taking into Gaza what the army said was a ""significant number"" of hostages.Israel has responded with air strikes.These have continued on Sunday morning, with the Israeli Air Force saying it was targeting ""operational infrastructure"" in Gaza.The Israeli military also carried out artillery strikes in southern Lebanon after mortars were fired from there towards Israeli positions in the disputed Mount Dov/Shebaa Farms area.Lebanon's militant Hezbollah movement claimed it had carried out the attack ""in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance"".More than 300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza since Palestinian militants infiltrated Israel from Gaza on Saturday morning, according to Palestinian health officials.Gazans received Israeli text messages overnight telling them to leave their homes and move to city centres or take refuge in shelters.The Israeli prime minister said in an overnight message that the war had been ""forced on us by a murderous attack by Hamas"", and the first stage would end in the coming hours when most of the militants on Israeli territory had been wiped out. Israel would restore security to its citizens and win, he added.The Israeli government also said it would cut off electricity, fuel and goods supplies to Gaza.Israel's nightmare scenario - armed Palestinian militants at large in the south of the country - began early on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath and festival of Simchat Torah.Gunmen cut through the Gaza perimeter fence, storming into Israel on motorbikes, paragliders and by sea. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman said they numbered in the high hundreds, while more than 3,000 rockets were fired across Israel across the day.""They attacked dozens of Israeli communities and IDF bases and went door to door, house to house,"" said Lt Col Jonathan Conricus.""They executed Israeli civilians in cold blood in their homes and then continued to drag into Gaza Israeli civilians and military personnel. I'm talking women, children, elderly, disabled.""Distressing videos emerged of Israeli civilians running for their lives from a festival in the desert, and of women being bundled into vehicles and kidnapped.This video can not be playedWatch: Party-goers recall militant attackIsraelis rang into news channels saying they were hiding in their homes and scared for their lives. The town of Netiv HaAsara said 15 of its residents were shot dead by Hamas militants.In the town of Sderot, a resident called Shlomi described seeing a ""sea of bodies, inside Sderot along the road"".Gradually the Israeli military began to reassert control over most of the southern communities. Hostages held in a dining room in Kibbutz Be'eri were eventually freed after 18 hours, Israeli media reported. Shortly afterwards further reports said troops had freed hostages in the town of Ofakim and the attackers holding them had been killed.US President Joe Biden spoke of America's ""rock-solid and unwavering"" support for Israel which was ""under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organisation"".Hamas's military wing said the number of Israelis captured was several times greater than dozens and they included senior military officers.By the end of Saturday, more than 1,500 people had been wounded in Gaza and 1,500 more in Israel, officials said.The army said Hamas's unprecedented level of violence would be met with an unprecedented response.Tens of thousands of reservists have been mobilised and are now expected to launch a ground operation in Gaza.On Saturday Israeli strikes destroyed the 11-storey Palestine Tower in downtown Gaza City, which houses Hamas radio stations in the rooftop.The Israeli air force said it struck ""military infrastructure in two multi-storey buildings used by senior Hamas terrorist operatives for carrying out terrorist activity"", and that it had warned occupants to evacuate before the attack.There was also violence in several locations in the West Bank on Saturday. Palestinian medics reported that six Palestinians were shot dead during confrontations with Israeli forces.Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif called on Palestinians everywhere to join the group's operation.""We have decided to put an end to these Israeli offences with God's help, so the enemy understands that the time of wreaking havoc without being held accountable is over,"" he said.Ismail Haniyeh, the leader-in-exile of Hamas, claimed that Palestinian factions intended to expand the violence to the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas spokesman, meanwhile told the BBC that the group had direct backing for the attack from Iran.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a political rival of Hamas - said the Palestinian people had the right to defend themselves against the ""terror of settlers and occupation troops"".There has been strong international condemnation of the Hamas attacks.UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was ""appalled by reports that civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes"", while the UK's Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, said it ""unequivocally condemns the horrific attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians"".However Saudi Arabia called for an immediate halt to the escalation, saying it had warned repeatedly about the dangers stemming from ""continued occupation"" and ""the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights"".Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

BBC,7-Oct,"Israel was taken by surprise by the most ambitious operation Hamas has ever launched from Gaza.The scale of what's been happening is unprecedented. Hamas breached the wire that separates Gaza from Israel in multiple places in the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.It came a day after the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973 that started a major Middle East war. The significance of the date will not have been lost on the Hamas leadership.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is at war and will exact a heavy price from its enemies.Videos and photos of dead Israelis, civilians as well as soldiers, are all over social media.Other videos of armed men from Hamas hauling soldiers and civilians into captivity in Gaza have enraged and alarmed Israelis.Within hours Israel was responding with air strikes into Gaza, killing many Palestinians. Its generals will be planning a ground operation next.The presence of Israeli hostages there means it will be even more complicated than previous incursions.For months, it has been clear that there was a deepening risk of an explosion between Palestinian armed groups and Israel. How and where it happened was a total surprise, outside the armed wing of Hamas.Israelis and Palestinians have been focusing on the West Bank, the territory between Jerusalem and the Jordanian border that Israel has occupied since 1967, where there has been almost continuous confrontation and violence throughout the year.Armed Palestinians, especially those operating out of the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus, have attacked Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers.The Israeli army has mounted dozens of raids. Armed settlers have taken the law into their own hands, with reprisals against Palestinian villages.Extreme religious nationalists inside Israel's right-wing government have repeated their claim that the occupied territories, in their entirety, are Jewish land.No one expected Hamas to conceive and meticulously plan such a complex and coordinated operation out of Gaza.This video can not be playedWatch: Video purportedly shows captured Israeli tank in GazaRecriminations have already started in Israel about the failure of its intelligence services to see what was coming. Israelis expect that an extensive network of informers, agents and high-tech surveillance will do its job.In the end, Israeli intelligence was blindsided by the Hamas operation, which came when Israelis were relaxing or praying during the weekend of a religious holiday.Hamas has said it acted because of threats to Jerusalem's mosques. During the last week, some Jews have prayed inside the Aqsa Mosque compound, the third holiest place for Muslims after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.The same precinct is also venerated by Jews, as it was the site of the biblical Jewish temple. Prayer by religious Jews on what they call the Temple Mount might not sound like much, but it is prohibited by Israel as Palestinians consider it highly provocative.Even so, by the standards of Jerusalem, always a tinderbox of national and religious conflict, it was not exceptionally tense.The complexity of the Hamas operation shows that it had been planned over months. It was not a hasty response to events in Jerusalem in the last week or so.The reasons why Hamas and Israel are once again at war run much deeper. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has been heating up even when it is far from the headlines of international news organisations.Even so, it has been largely ignored by countries that still officially call for peace via a two-state solution, shorthand for an independent Palestine alongside Israel. For a while, during the Oslo peace process of the 1990s, the prospect of two states was a real hope. Now it is an empty slogan.The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has not been a priority for President Joe Biden's administration in Washington DC. It has been trying to find a way to offer security guarantees to Saudi Arabia in return for a rapprochement with Israel.The last American attempt to relaunch a peace process failed a decade ago, during the administration of President Barack Obama.At the heart of the trouble is the intractable and unresolved century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the river Jordan. These rapidly-escalating events prove once again that the conflict cannot simply be managed. When it is left to fester, violence and bloodshed are guaranteed.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,10-Oct,"As Israel rushed onto a war footing on Saturday morning, young army reservists around the country were already moving faster than the military machine.""From 6.30am, we were itching to know why we weren't being called up already,"" said Michael Goldberg, a 24-year-old reservist in Jerusalem.Mr Goldberg had woken up early to a flood of videos of Hamas's devastating attack. He had only recently returned to Jerusalem, to visit family after moving to the US six months earlier. Watching the attack unfold, he knew instantly that he would not be returning to the US.Instead, Mr Goldberg began to pack underwear and socks, and make whatever other preparations he could to serve his country.""I guess in most places, you wait for the call,"" he said. ""In Israel you start to get ready before it comes.""Israel is still reeling from Saturday's surprise attack by Hamas militants, who killed at least 1,000 people and wounded many more. In the few days since, the nation of more than nine million has called up a record 360,000 reservists to help respond.Israel's army relies on an enormous reserve contingent, made up of civilians who have completed their compulsory national service but can be mobilised again for duty until the age of 40.On Saturday afternoon, Mr Goldberg finally got the call he was waiting for. But he wasn't mobilised immediately. Sitting in his family home early on Monday morning, he was impatient to go.""There is a tremendous amount of fear,"" he said. ""But you are also inspired in ways you have never been before. I realised that this is the defining moment of my life.""Mr Goldberg's eagerness has been mirrored across the nation and beyond. So many reservists have felt compelled to return to duty that Israel's El Al airline announced it would run extra flights to bring home those abroad.Some who have already joined up have complained that there is not enough kit to go around. And at some muster points in Jerusalem at the weekend, volunteers were turned back because their units were already over capacity, or still catching up.""I drove one of my sons to the base today and they said we are not organised enough yet, come back in two days,"" said Alan Sacks, a Jerusalem lawyer and father of six.Of Mr Sacks' five sons, three had already been mobilised over the weekend. One was still trying to find a place. His youngest, aged 25, was ""very much in the hotspot at the moment,"" Mr Sacks said - working with a special forces unit near Gaza.""Two weeks ago, Israel was torn apart, left against right,"" he said, referring to recent large-scale protests over controversial judicial reforms. ""And now you have all these reservists lining up together to go. It's an extraordinary transformation.""Mr Sacks was receiving updates via WhatsApp on Monday from his mobilised sons. He smiled with pride when his phone buzzed with a selfie from the 25-year-old, who had been able to communicate the least.The nation's civilian military was ""fundamental to the existence of Israel,"" he said. ""This is not an anonymous army, everyone has a child or a cousin or a father who is involved.""Calls have now gone out to reservists from their early twenties all the way up to those aged 40 - the cut-off age at which you become exempt from duty.Shay, 40, a taxi driver in Jerusalem, who did not want to give his full name, was on holiday in Greece when he got the call. It had been 20 years since his national service, he said, but he had done refresher training over the years to avoid becoming rusty with a gun.""Even if I was exempt I would still go,"" he said. ""I want to go for me, and for my country, but I have two young children and I am scared.""Elkana Bar Etan, a 38-year-old reservist, didn't wait for the call. ""I just texted my commander to say I'm here, and he texted right away and said come,"" Mr Bar Etan said.He was immediately deployed to the border with Lebanon, from where he spoke to the BBC. As he spoke, mortar strikes could be heard in the background.""I never in my worst nightmares imagined that this would be the circumstances for being called up again,"" he said.""I'm here on the border, in full uniform, and I'm thinking about my children. But my decision was simple, really, you feel the obligation.""Even the cut off age did not stop the volunteers. At Jerusalem's main bus station on Monday, Nissim Baranes, 45, was sitting in uniform waiting for a public bus south that, so far, didn't seem to be coming.""I think the public transport is also operating on emergency terms,"" he said.Mr Baranes was doubly exempt from duty, because not only was he over 40 but he also had six children - the number that excuses a parent from being called up.And yet there he was, alone at the bus station, with a modest rucksack, trying to get himself closer to somewhere he could be useful.""It is a good feeling to put on the uniform again,"" he said. ""These are hard days for Israel.""For some parents, this is not the first time they have watched their sons and daughters go to take part in this conflict.One of Mr Sacks' sons served in the 2014 Gaza war. During that time, he and his wife Judith would sit on the front balcony of their house, dreading the appearance of a uniformed soldier walking up the driveway, Judith said.That feeling was now rushing back, she said, with tears in her eyes. ""Then there was one child serving, now there are two serving and two more waiting to go in.""The reservists already in position and those still waiting to go said they had no idea how long this new mobilisation would last. Israel has launched waves of retaliatory air strikes against the Gaza Strip which have killed at least 900 people. Many are expecting a ground invasion that could bring weeks of suffering.""There is a mixed feeling of wanting it to end now and wanting to change the Middle East,"" said Michael Goldberg, the 24-year-old reservist who was waiting impatiently to leave.""There is a lot of mixed emotion, a lot of adrenaline, and a lot of unknowns,"" he said.Idan Ben Ari contributed to this report.

BBC,10-Oct,"Securing direct flights from Israel to the UK has become increasingly difficult with more airlines cancelling flights after the Hamas attacks.Virgin is now operating one flight to and from Tel Aviv a day instead of two and BA is flying one round trip.EasyJet, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have suspended flights from Israel into the UK.One travel agent said he been ""inundated"" with calls from people trying to get flights back to the UK.Jeremy Segel, director of West End Travel, which specialises in trips to Israel, said many flights were booked up with only the ""odd seat"" available.He arrived back in the UK on Monday with his family who had travelled as part of a 44-strong group to celebrate the Jewish festival of Sukkot.While his BA flight was delayed, Mr Segel told the BBC people were ""panicking"" in Ben Gurion Airport as they learned of flights being cancelled.  At one stage, ""everyone started running"" in the airport over a false alarm of an attack.""People are very nervous, people are very defensive,"" he said.BA's website shows that its earliest flight to the UK from Ben Gurion Airport is on Monday 16 October and a one-way ticket costing more than £1,300. For the following Monday, a ticket is about £226.Virgin Atlantic and Israel's national carrier El Al - which is still operating two flights daily to London Heathrow and two to Luton Airport - have no availability on their UK-bound services until next week.Several airlines have introduced flexible booking policies and allowed customers to change travel dates for free.Flightradar24, a website which tracks flights, told the BBC many airlines had cancelled journeys due to safety concerns. But it pointed out that the airspace over Israel isn't closed, so the number of flights flying to or from Tel Aviv ""is currently down to individual operators"".Despite a dwindling number of direct flights leaving Israel, Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, urged UK nationals wishing to leave to use commercial transport, with no UK government evacuation currently planned.The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and against all travel to certain parts of the region.""There are air flights, and of course there are land borders with friendly nations - with Egypt, with Jordan,"" Mr Cleverly said. ""If you seek to leave Israel we are working with the air industry and with Israeli air traffic control to maintain those flights.""One woman from London, who asked the BBC to withhold her name, remains in Tel Aviv along with her husband, another adult couple and 12 children.She said the group was ""going through a lot of trauma"" and had been forced to search for places to hide when air-raid sirens had sounded. The children especially were ""shaking from fear"".""I can't tell you about the fear we are living through,"" she said. ""We have been trying to contact anyone to get us home.""She said she had tried to call the British Embassy in Israel but had received no reply.""We are very disappointed as we live in England and no one is willing to help us get back safely,"" she said.

BBC,10-Oct,"Jewish schools have stepped up security as concerns grow about a possible rise in antisemitism directed at children.Patrols have increased around some schools in London and Manchester, with parents telling the BBC they are ""scared"" for their children's safety.Some pupils have been told blazers are optional in public places so they cannot be easily identified as Jewish.Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the safety of the UK's Jewish community was an ""absolute priority"".""History has shown us that Jews in the UK are targeted in response to actions in the Middle East, completely inappropriately so,"" he told the BBC.Three days after Hamas launched a murderous assault on Israel, more than 1,000 people have died on the Israel-side. Retaliatory strikes on Gaza have killed 830.Pupils at the Jewish Free School in Kenton, north London, have been told there will be no after-school detentions and wearing a blazer with the school's logo is optional.""The most important thing is to ensure the safe passage of students between home and school and to make sure that this school is set up to care for our children during the school day,"" headteacher David Moody said in an email to parents.Suzi, whose 14-year-old son attends the school, said: ""The waves that are rippling through go beyond the school to the community.""As a parent it's very hard because you want to protect your children, both emotionally and physically.""Her elder daughter, aged 18, was a former pupil at the school and two years below Nathanel Young who was killed in the attack by Hamas on Saturday.""He was walking the same corridors as her,"" said Suzi, whose full name we are not using.She said that ""sadly"", as a Jewish community, they were used to strict security in communal places.""This is just stepping up on another level because of what has happened. We are all in a state of shock and mourning,"" she added.In Manchester, at another Jewish school, attendance has dropped off and there have been increased police patrols.John Dalziel, headteacher at King David School, said police had been on site on Tuesday morning to try to reassure pupils and parents.He is also advising students to consider taking off blazers or covering the crest on their uniform when in public.He said he has told pupils to be proud of who they are and to report any antisemitic attacks.Another mum, Michal, who has three children at Broughton Jewish Cassel Fox Primary School in Salford, said patrols in her area have increased.""They have put extra security in place, cancelled school trips and they're making sure all doors are locked during the day,"" she said.""The most terrifying thing about it is there are people on the streets of Manchester who are actively celebrating the death of Jewish people.""Michal, whose surname we are not using, said despite the school doing its best to protect the children, she feared for their safety.The heightened security is being put in place by local police with help from the Community Security Trust, a charity which helps Jewish people in the UK with security and antisemitism.It said it was working with the government to help co-ordinate and plan security, with a special focus on schools.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has insisted the government was doing everything it could to keep the UK's Jewish community safe.On Tuesday, he said he wanted to remind everyone that Hamas was a proscribed terror organisation and anyone found supporting them would be held to account.Home Secretary Suella Braverman has written to police chiefs in England and Wales urging them to use the ""full force of the law"" against shows of support for Hamas or attempts to intimidate the UK's Jewish community.She wrote: ""Behaviours that are legitimate in some circumstances, for example the waving of a Palestinian flag, may not be legitimate such as when intended to glorify acts of terrorism.""Nor is it acceptable to drive through Jewish neighbourhoods, or single out Jewish members of the public, to aggressively chant or wave pro-Palestinian symbols at,"" she added.On Monday, three people were arrested following a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the Israeli embassy in Kensington, west London.Around the same time, British Jews gathered in Downing Street for a vigil to light candles for the victims and pray for lost loved ones and those held captive.In the predominantly Jewish area of Golders Green, north London, ""Free Palestine"" graffiti daubed on bridges is being investigated.""No-one should be subjected to violence or harassment because of who they are,"" British Transport Police said.In the BBC interview, the foreign secretary urged UK nationals who wanted to leave Israel to use commercial transport in the first instance, as he confirmed that no UK government-facilitated evacuation was under way yet.Asked whether that policy might change, Mr Cleverly said things were ""very fast moving"" and he would not ""speculate as to what might happen in the future"".He said the situation in Israel was unlike many other consular issues because of the ""very, very large number of British-Israeli nationals"", many of whom regard Israel as their permanent home or are serving in the military.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,4 days ago,"Dozens of Arab citizens of Israel have been arrested in connection with social media posts about the war in Gaza.Among them is a well-known singer and influencer from Nazareth, Dalal Abu Amneh, who was held in police custody for two days before being released on Wednesday on bail. She's now under house arrest until Monday.According to her lawyer, Abeer Baker, she was accused of ""disruptive behaviour"" by police officers, who said her posts could incite violence among her followers.The post that attracted police attention was an image of the Palestinian flag with the Arabic motto: ""There is no victor but God.""Ms Baker says the singer, who is well known across the Arab world for her songs about Palestinian heritage, was expressing a religious sentiment. Israeli authorities interpreted the singer's post as a call to arms for Palestinians.Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, police in Israel have adopted what they call a ""zero tolerance policy"" towards social media activity deemed to express support for Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and designated as a terrorist group by Israel, as well as the US, UK, and many other countries.Ms Abu Amneh is one of dozens of Arab citizens of Israel arrested in connection with social media posts about the war.Many others have been suspended or sacked from their jobs or face disciplinary action from their universities.Israeli Arabs - many of whom prefer to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel - make up a fifth of the country's population.Since Hamas's attack, police say they have investigated and detained more than 100 people for their social media activity. Sixty-three have been arrested and questioned in Jerusalem alone.""Anyone inciting against the State of Israel, its government symbols, elected officials, military personnel and police, should be aware that the Israel Police will respond firmly and without leniency,"" said Israel's Police Commissioner, Yaakov Shabtai, at a meeting with senior leaders this week.Adalah, the Legal Centre for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, believes the number of detained is higher as more arrests have been made recently.By comparison, during the Israel-Gaza conflict in May 2021, only 16 people - 15 of whom were Arab - were charged with inciting violence, according to a report released by Adalah.Human rights activists worry this spike in detentions is due to the police adopting a wider interpretation of what constitutes incitement to violence.In the Bedouin city of Rahat, for example, police have detained a former mayoral candidate, Dr Amer al-Huzail, who shared on social media a map of the Gaza Strip with an analysis of possible scenarios for an expected ground operation by Israeli forces.This has led him to be accused of aiding the enemy in a time of war.But even when no criminal charges are filed, some people in Israel are still facing heavy consequences for their social media activity.Lawyers working for Adalah say they have received more than 40 cases of Israeli Arab workers suspended or fired from their workplaces overnight.""People are getting their livelihood threatened sometimes just for liking a post,"" says Salam Irsheid, a lawyer at the organisation. ""We even have a case of a worker who is at risk of being fired for liking a news report on the situation in Gaza on social media.""Arab students in Israel are also facing disciplinary actions from their universities.Last week, Ariel Porat, the president of Tel Aviv University, said that a few students had been flagged for expressing ""support for the atrocities of Hamas"".""We will be very strict with this handful of students,"" he wrote in a statement on the university's website, ""and when we feel the offence is criminal in nature, we shall report them to the police. We will act swiftly, as required in this sensitive situation, but will not deny any student the right to a fair investigation.""Lawyers from Adalah say they have received complaints from 83 students who have been suspended from schools across the country and, in some cases, told to leave their accommodation at short notice.""None of the cases are about actions, demonstrations or participating in illegal things. They're all about posts on social media,"" says Dr Hassan Jabareen, the general director of Adalah.""More than 90% of the posts are clearly against the war, against Israel's actions in Gaza, supporting the victims of war in Gaza,"" he adds.""Ten percent of the posts fall in a vague area that may be interpreted as indirectly supporting the acts of Hamas against civilians.""In normal times, they wouldn't be interpreted like that, but these days Israel tends to give the harshest interpretation to these posts.""Public outrage at the attack by Hamas, which killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, in areas near the Gaza Strip, has also led to anger at Jewish Israeli voices calling for de-escalation.Last Sunday, a prominent left-wing ultra-Orthodox Jewish journalist, Israel Frey, had to be escorted by police away from his home in Tel Aviv for his own protection.Protesters had gathered outside the building and shot flares at his apartment after he posted on social media a video where he was praying for civilians in Gaza.And on Wednesday, Ofer Cassif, a Jewish lawmaker for the Arab-led Hadash-Taal alliance, was suspended from the Israeli parliament for 45 days after he strongly condemned the bombing of Gaza.In one of his most recent posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, he criticised the police who, he said, hadn't intervened promptly in Mr Frey's defence.""Armed police forces are sent to arrest anyone who shows a trace of empathy for the massacres in Gaza,"" he wrote.""But the police have no desire to protect a left-wing journalist whose life is in danger.""© 2023 BBC.

BBC,10-Oct,"This video can not be playedWatch: Israeli soldier's funeral interrupted by sirensMore than 10 British citizens are feared dead or missing after the Hamas attack on Israel, an official UK source has told the BBC.The victims include a 20-year-old soldier and a Scottish grandfather.The UK government believes up to 60,000 British nationals are in Israel or Gaza. It has said it is assisting families but no evacuation is planned.The latest official death toll from Israel is 900. Palestinian authorities say 260 have died in air strikes.Here is what we know about British victims so far.The 20-year-old attended North London's JFS Jewish School before moving to Israel to serve in the military.Its headteacher said the school's community is ""devastated"" and ""heartbroken"" at the news of his death.He added: ""Nathanel is fondly remembered within the school and we think of him with nothing but love.""Mr Young's funeral, held at Israel's national cemetery Mount Herzl, was interrupted after loud bangs were heard over Jerusalem.The authorities had asked that no more than 50 people attend the open-air service so that it did not become a target for militants.In the end more than 1,000 turned out and listened as Mr Young's younger brother Elliot paid tribute to him.But when his sister started to remember him, an emergency siren pierced the tranquillity and prompted mourners to throw themselves to the ground, taking cover under trees and between gravestones.Repeated explosions could be heard. Some began reciting prayers, others began to video-call loved ones.After a few minutes, the alarm fell silent, and the funeral continued.Bernard Cowan, who grew up in Glasgow before settling in Israel with his wife and three children, was killed in the attack, his family confirmed.They said in a statement: ""We are grieving the loss of our son and brother, Bernard Cowan, who was horrifically murdered on Saturday during the surprise terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.""We ask for privacy at this time while we process this huge loss to our family, both at home and in Israel, and to the Jewish community in Glasgow where he will be sorely missed.""Sammy Stein, chairman of Glasgow Friends of Israel, said Mr Cowan - who was a grandfather - returned to the city often and regularly visited his peace advocacy stall in the city centre.He told BBC Scotland that Mr Cowan lived ""metres"" from the Gaza barrier, adding: """"It was quiet, it was peaceful and it was in the country. He loved it.""Mr Marlowe was working as a security guard at the Supernova music festival, where 260 people were killed when it was stormed by militants.The 26-year-old was reported missing from the event, which took place at the Re'im kibbutz around 3.7 miles (6km) from the Gaza barrier.He also attended North London's JFS Jewish School.Head teacher David Moody said ""we have seen reports that Jake Marlowe is missing and we all pray that he is found soon"".The family of Daniel Darlington have said they believe he is among those killed.In a statement posted on Instagram, his sister referred to him as Danny and ""baby brother"". She said he was killed at the Nir Oz kibbutz alongside a friend.She wrote: ""Only days before he was riding his bike, laughing, taking photos of sunsets and enjoying life's simple pleasures.""Daniel had intended to leave for Tel Aviv the day before the militants struck, she wrote, but had decided to stay an extra day to show his friend around the kibbutz.Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

BBC,9-Oct,"Israel's war with Hamas following the militant group's unprecedented and deadly weekend attack is also sending shockwaves through domestic US politics.The crisis is creating new headaches for the Biden administration, sharpening the focus on the current turmoil in Congress and threatening to add an extra level of unpredictability to the 2024 US elections.And while the American public tends to pay slight attention to events abroad, the horrifying images of civilian deaths from the Middle East - and the news that Americans are among the casualties - ensures that this story will grab the national attention.Already Joe Biden's critics are lining up to place the blame for violence in Israel squarely at the president's feet.They've accused Iran of masterminding the attack and say that US policies toward that nation, including allowing it to increase oil sales and have access to $6bn (£4.9bn) in frozen assets as part of a deal to achieve the release of some jailed American citizens, was a signal of American ""weakness"".A senior administration official on Saturday said that was a ""ridiculous charge,"" adding that only non-Iranian third-party groups have had access to the $6bn, which can only be spent on humanitarian aid.Former president Donald Trump, in a speech in New Hampshire on Monday, pledged to reinstate all US sanctions on Iran and reimpose a US travel ban on all ""terror-afflicted"" majority Muslim nations.Mr Trump pointed to his successful negotiation of the Abraham Accords between Israel and two Persian Gulf states as an example of what had been a trend toward peace in the Middle East.Some experts, however, have said that by bypassing the Palestinian issue, those accords - and the recent Biden administration push to normalise diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - may have been a contributing factor in the Hamas attack.One of Mr Trump's presidential rivals, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, also accused Democratic administrations of being too soft on Iran.""Ultimately, this was an attack by the Iranians,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said. ""US policy under both Biden and Obama, they just had rose-coloured glasses with respect to Iran.""While the lion's share of Republican criticism was directed at Mr Biden, the attack on Israel also exposed some fault lines within the party - particularly on the changing views among conservatives on the merits of the kind of interventionist foreign policy that was long a hallmark of Republican presidencies.Former vice-president Mike Pence used the moment to launch one of his most direct critiques of what he said was a nativist and isolationist worldviews of some of his Republican rivals.""It's absolutely essential that we call out leaders in the Republican Party,"" he said in a statement released by his campaign. ""Voices of appeasement like Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis, I believe have run contrary to the tradition in our party where America is the leader of the free world.""On Monday morning, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joined in with the Republican chorus blaming Mr Biden's policies for laying the groundwork for the attack.Mr McCarthy was a victim of an uprising among right-wing conservatives, and his ousting has essentially frozen the chamber until Republicans can unite behind a new speaker - a process that could take at least several days more.Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, the mastermind of the move against the then-speaker, dismissed accusations that his actions may have made it more difficult for the US Congress to come to Israel's aid, noting that America gives Israel $3bn (£2.45bn) in military support every year.""There is no ask from Israel that we are unable to meet because it's going to take us a few days to pick a new speaker,"" he said, adding that the world doesn't spend much time thinking about Mr McCarthy's political career.It was an opportunity for Mr McCarthy's supporters to get another round of digs at a colleague they now thoroughly revile.""I look at the world and all the threats that are out there,"" Michael McCaul, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday. ""What kind of message are we sending to our adversaries when we can't govern, when we're dysfunctional, when we don't even have a Speaker of the House?""The Biden administration has said there is no immediate need for a congressionally approved aid package for Israel. But two senior officials told US senators during a briefing today that new assistance should be included in a legislative package that also contains continued support for Ukraine.Given the resistance to additional Ukraine funding among some Republicans, however, it remains to be seen whether such a move would make such an aid package more likely to pass - or less. A social media post earlier today by Republican Senator Josh Hawley seemed to suggest the latter.""Israel is facing existential threat,"" he wrote. ""Any funding for Ukraine should be redirected to Israel immediately.""If Republican fault lines have been exposed by the Israel crisis, the same cannot be said for divisions on the left - at least for the moment.While the Democratic Party has traditionally been vocal advocates for Israel, that support has ebbed in recent years as the party has moved to the left and its criticism of the right-wing policies of Israel's Likud-led government - including its aggressive expansion of settlements in the occupied territories - has intensified.A January 2023 Gallup Poll showed more Democrats sympathised with Palestinians (49%) than Israelis (38%) for the first time in the poll's 22-year history.The ferocity and indiscriminate nature of the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians, however, has obscured these divisions.While some far-left groups have rallied to express backing for the Palestinians, mainstream Democrats have been vocal in their support for Israel and quick to denounce signs of dissent from their side.Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Cori Bush of Missouri, two of the more outspoken critics of Israel in the House of Representatives, offered sympathies for Israeli and Palestinian civilian casualties while calling for the end of US aid to Israel. Those comments prompted condemnation from several of their fellow Democrats.""It sickens me that while Israelis clean the blood of their family members shot in their homes, they believe Congress should strip US funding to our democratic ally and allow innocent civilians to suffer,"" said Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey.Ms Bush and Ms Tlaib are in the minority of their party for the moment. Bernie Sanders, one of the leaders of the progressive left, issued a statement on Saturday saying he absolutely condemned ""the horrifying attack"".""There is no justification for this violence, and innocent people on both sides will suffer hugely because of it,"" he wrote on social media.As headlines about Israeli civilian deaths are replaced by coverage of what could be a lengthy Israeli ground campaign in the Gaza Strip, however, the sentiment among Democrats could begin to shift to where it was earlier this year.The situation in the Middle East has shifted dramatically in a matter of days. Given the existing cross-currents and partisan divisions inside the US, the domestic political dynamics of the current crisis are likely to be equally unpredictable.This video can not be playedWatch: The story from inside the Supernova festival site© 2023 BBC.

Nepal said 10 of its citizens had been killed.Other countries which have reported citizens killed, abducted or missing in the violence in Israel include the US, UK and Germany.Thailand's labour minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn told AFP news agency that some 5,000 Thai labourers work in the zone where fighting has been taking place, but that Israeli forces had begun moving them to safety. He added that 1,099 workers have registered to return home.Workers at a farm in Mivtahim, a town near the Gaza Strip, described Hamas militants storming their farm after rockets were fired in the early hours of Saturday.""The Hamas militants fired a rocket first, then they stormed our farm.

But he warned that militants might still be at large.At least 700 people in Israel are reported to have been killed.Another 560 people have been killed in Gaza in retaliatory Israeli strikes.A Hamas spokesman claimed that four Israelis taken hostage during Saturday's attack were among those killed in the latest strikes, but there was no independent confirmation.Israel's defence minister meanwhile ordered a ""complete siege"" of Gaza.The two million Palestinians in the Hamas-ruled territory are also bracing themselves for a possible ground operation, with Israeli forces massing nearby.At the start of Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there were seven or eight areas in southern Israel where troops were still fighting gunmen.The included Be'eri, a kibbutz that was infiltrated by about 70 militants overnight, possibly using a cross-border tunnel, it added.A tunnel exit was also reportedly found near Kfar Aza, another kibbutz where a family was being held hostage.But a few hours later, the IDF's chief spokesman, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, declared that security forces had regained control of border communities and killed a number of militants.""We are now carrying out searches in all of the communities and clearing the area,"" he said, adding that ""it is possible there are still terrorists"".This video can not be playedWatch and listen: Terrifying moment Ashkelon hit by rockets, sending BBC team running for coverAdm Hagari said the IDF planned to secure breaches in the Gaza perimeter fence with tanks and aircraft and that it had mobilised a record 300,000 reservists.He also said that about 4,400 rockets had been fired from Gaza towards Israel since Saturday morning, when hundreds of Hamas militants used them as cover to infiltrate Israel.Not long after the briefing, rocket sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as fresh barrages were launched. Several people were reportedly injured in the southern cities of Ashkelon and Ashdod.For Israelis collectively traumatised by the assault from Gaza, the scale of the number of casualties continues to shock.Israel's health ministry has not confirmed how many people have been killed, but Israeli TV channels report that the death toll exceeds 700.

He said fighter jets would also be sent.Further military aid to Israel would be sent in the coming days, the White House said, adding that the US was working to ensure Israel's enemies did not try to seek advantage from the situation.The large deployment reflects American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.In particular, the US is eager to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the conflict. It is backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi has expressed support for the Hamas attack, saying Israel needed to be held to account for endangering the region.Hamas has said assistance from Iran helped it carry out its attack, which involved rockets, drones and militants on paragliders and saw hundreds of fighters break through Israeli border fortifications around the Gaza Strip.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not seen evidence of direct Iranian involvement, but that Iran had been helping the Gaza-based group for years.""Hamas wouldn't be Hamas without the support that it's gotten over many years from Iran.

BBC,8-Oct,"Sunday should have been the start of the working week and the return to school in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, with the end of the Jewish high holidays.Instead, the streets were virtually empty.Just a day ago, some of the hundreds of Palestinian gunmen from Gaza were at large here. And shocking events have continued to unfold nearby.Social media video shows Israeli forces pursuing militants who had stolen a car. They were killed in a dramatic shootout on the roadside.The only small crowds we encounter are by the Barzilai Medical Center. Weary medics stand by the entrance to the emergency ward. They have treated more than 400 patients because of the surprise attack by Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza.""It was very difficult, a lot of casualties have been brought one after one, one after one very quickly,"" says the hospital's general director, Prof Hezi Levy. ""I am very experienced, but I haven't seen in my life such a scenario.""One 30-year-old man having a cigarette looks badly shaken.

Everyone got scared and started running towards the road to drive home. As we got on the road, the gunfire began. It was really shocking. People were murdered, there were car accidents,"" the man says.""I called the police. Nobody could help us. For an hour and a half, we sat inside a battle, helpless. Eventually I got into the car with some people. I'm a medic so I tried to evacuate two wounded. As I reached a junction I saw people in army fatigues - but they weren't military - they started firing at me.""Many Israelis I meet are shocked at how their powerful security forces were overwhelmed by the scale and complexity of the Hamas operation. Now there are complaints of a lack of help from the authorities.One tearful couple are making their own inquiries going from hospital to hospital. They do not know if their missing son is injured, dead or among the dozens of hostages who have been snatched by armed fighters and taken back to Gaza.A distraught mother, Rachel Ezra confronts an MP who is visiting the hospital.

BBC,8-Oct,"Many Israelis would have been asleep when it began.Saturday was the Jewish Sabbath and also a holy festival day, meaning families were planning to spend time at home together or in synagogue, and friends were meeting up.But out of the dawn sky, a hail of rockets signalled the start of an attack that was unprecedented in its scale and co-ordination.For years, Israel has fortified the barrier between itself and the small Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Within hours, its impenetrability was exposed as flawed.BBC News has been analysing footage taken by militants and civilians on the ground to piece together how Hamas co-ordinated their most sophisticated attack ever from Gaza.At around 06:30 local time, the rockets began to fly.The Islamist militant organisation - which controls Gaza and is designated as a terrorist group in the UK and elsewhere around the world - uses this tactic frequently.The rudimentary rockets often struggle to evade Israel's advanced Iron Dome missile defence system - but thousands were fired in a short space of time to overwhelm it.The scale suggests months of planning and stockpiling. Hamas says it fired 5,000 in the first round (Israel says it was half that number).Air raid sirens began to sound as far afield as Tel Aviv - 60km (38 miles) from Gaza - and western Jerusalem and smoke was seen rising above towns where there had been direct hits.As the rockets continued to launch, fighters were gathering where they planned to penetrate the heavily fortified Gaza barrier.Although Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, it still controls its airspace, shared border and shoreline.As well as regular military patrols around the perimeter - which is a concrete wall in some places and a fence in others - there is also a network of cameras and sensors to prevent incursions.But within hours, the barrier had been breached again and again.Some Hamas fighters tried to bypass the barrier completely, including by flying over it on paragliders (unverified footage showed at least seven drifting above Israel) and by boat.The Israel Defense Forces said they had repelled two Hamas attempts to cross into Israel by landing vessels on the beach.But what sets this attack apart is the several co-ordinated, direct assaults on barrier crossing points.At 05:50 local time, a Telegram account associated with Hamas's armed wing posted the first images from the ground, taken at Kerem Shalom - the most southern of Gaza's crossings.They showed militants overrunning a checkpoint and the bloodied bodies of two Israeli soldiers on the ground.Another image showed at least five motorbikes, each carrying two militants armed with rifles, passing through a hole which had been cut in the wire fence section of the barrier.At a less guarded section, a bulldozer was seen demolishing a stretch of barbed wire-topped fencing.Dozens of seemingly unarmed people were gathered there, and some began to run through the gap.At Erez - the furthest north of the Gaza crossings, around 43.4km (27 miles) from Kerem Shalom - Hamas was swarming another crossing.Footage was posted on one of the group's propaganda channels. It shows an explosion at the concrete barrier, which served as a signal to start the assault, and a militant can then be seen waving a group of fighters towards the blast site.Eight men in bulletproof vests and carrying rifles run towards the heavily fortified checkpoint and fire at Israeli troops.This video can not be playedMilitants attack Israel/Gaza border crossing point in propaganda footageLater in the video, the bodies of Israeli soldiers are seen lying on the floor as the militants go from room to room sweeping the compound, clearly organised and trained.Gaza has seven official crossings - six are controlled by Israel, one into Egypt is controlled by Cairo.But within the space of a few hours, Hamas had found ways to enter Israeli territory along the length of the barrier.Hamas fighters swept out of Gaza in all directions. We now know from the Israeli authorities that they assaulted 27 different locations, seemingly with orders to kill on sight.The furthest Hamas penetrated was the town of Ofakim, which lies 22.5km (14 miles) east of Gaza. The map below shows the different areas they reached.In Sderot, militants were seen standing on the back of a pick-up truck being driven through the town, which lies around 3km (1.8 miles) to the east of Gaza.Around a dozen armed fighters were seen fanning out through the empty streets of Ashkelon, just to the north of the Erez crossing which had just been stormed.Similar scenes were repeated across southern Israel and civilians were told by the military to hide indoors.At a music festival near Re'im, gunmen fired at will at a large group of young people who had gathered in the desert.An eyewitness told the BBC how the militants were driving around a van loaded with weapons and spent three hours searching the area for other Israelis to target.This video can not be playedWatch: A day of violence and fearWe now know that hostages were taken from the festival and other locations and transported back into Gaza. Israel says 100 people - soldiers and civilians - have been abducted.Footage taken in the town of Be'ri and verified by the BBC shows around four civilians being forcibly led away by militants.Several videos have circulated online of Israelis, some of them heavily injured, being paraded through Gaza's crowded streets.Other unverified atrocities too graphic to publish were captured on camera, including a motorist being dragged from his car and having his throat slashed, and the bodies of dead civilians and soldiers being defiled.As well as targeting Israeli communities, Hamas also attacked two military sites: a base at Zikim and another at Re'im.Footage taken from near Re'im shows the aftermath, with several burned-out cars scattered along the road to the base. It's unclear how many people were killed during the fighting.Hamas's social media channels have repeatedly shared images of dead Israeli soldiers. BBC News has not verified these images.Within just a few hours of the rocket barrage beginning, hundreds of Israelis were dead - and it happened in a way no-one thought was possible.Help began to arrive in the stricken southern region within a few hours but Hamas, for a time, was in effective control of pieces of territory outside of Gaza.The speed and deadliness of the surprise attack has stunned Israel. Questions over how it was able to happen will be asked for years.By mid-morning, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared: ""We are at war.""© 2023 BBC.

BBC,5 days ago,"They are still finding bodies in the neighbourhoods near Gaza.Warning: Some readers may find details in this article distressing.Recovery teams on Wednesday pulled a woman's body from the rubble in Kibbutz Be'eri. She was naked, her feet bound with metal wire.One of the team said the bodies of more than 20 children had been found nearby, tied together and burned.Even experienced workers are struggling: deaths like this are enough to break the living.In Nir Oz, a line of ambulances and black vans processed slowly past the fence as we entered the kibbutz. This is now a place of stillness, the community frozen in the chaos of the attack.Cats provide the only movement - sliding between bright toys strewn across gardens, the collapsed roofs, the charred gaping skeletons of people's homes.Overhead, loud explosions regularly fill the silence. Gaza is only three miles away.Hamas gunmen attacked early in Nir Oz. Survivors say one in four people are dead or missing, including a British man, Danny Darlington.He was born and raised in Manchester, before recently moving to Germany, and had been visiting family in the kibbutz.A neighbour identified Danny's body on the morning after the attack, but the family are still waiting for official confirmation that he is dead.Danny was not meant to be in the kibbutz that morning. His half-brother, Lior Peri, was expecting him back in Tel Aviv the day before, but Danny decided to stay on an extra night.Lior received a text message on Saturday morning, as the attack unfolded, saying: ""S**t, big balagan [chaos] in the kibbutz.""""That's the last I heard from him,"" Lior told me. ""Now I'm trying to help the family in Manchester. They are really in the dark.""Lior's father, Haim Peri, also went missing from Nir Or during the attack.Haim used to drive sick children from Gaza to Israeli hospitals. Some of the artwork he loved to collect is still standing amid the debris scattered through the house and garden.Haim and his wife, Osnat, were hiding in their safe room when Hamas gunmen first broke in. The door to the safe room held fast, but the gunmen returned with reinforcements.This time, Lior says, Haim told his wife to hide behind the sofa in the safe room, then opened the door and gave himself up.His wife was still hiding when a second group of people burst in - less disciplined, more destructive. They ransacked the house. The door to the safe room was still open, but it was dark inside and they did not bother to look.Haim has now been formally listed as a hostage.There is frustration from many families here at the slow pace of information about the dead and missing.Tent cities lit by floodlights have sprung up at army bases to identify the dead. Plastic-robed medics work to a constant soundtrack of generators, fighter planes and cicadas.At one centre, we were shown more than a dozen shipping containers, their shelves stacked with body bags of all different sizes.Staff say the remains of around 1,000 people have passed through here - some in the care of Captain Maayan. Army regulations mean she cannot give her last name.""I didn't see one body that was shot just once,"" she told me.""In each body, I saw abuses and torture, and so many cuts, so many gunshots, so many bruises to the head and to the limbs. It doesn't feel like we're in war and we're seeing casualties. It feels like we're in a massacre, and we're looking at a massacre.""It took nine hours for the army to arrive in Nir Oz. With hundreds of thousands of troops now ranged along the border, Israel is eyeing the next stage of this war - a major offensive operation inside Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas.Lior Peri feels out of sync with Israel's current national mood.""Revenge is a very strong emotion, which a lot of people have now,"" he says. ""But if they will hear us, hear the families, maybe they will reconsider. Maybe they will say: we will have time for revenge later on but before winning the war, let's do whatever we can to get out of this hostage situation.""The families of Israel's hostages and missing are still frozen in the hours after the attack, left without answers, and caught between two different traumas: their nation's and their own.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,6 days ago,"Murdered British-Israeli man Yonatan Rapoport has been remembered as ""a great father"" who stood ""bravely against"" Hamas.Mr Rapoport, known as Yoni, was killed in the Palestinian militant group's attack on kibbutz Be'eri last week.His mother described him as ""a lovely man"" with ""a wonderful sense of humour and the most amazing smile that just lit up the room"".The UK government says Hamas has killed ""at least"" nine British nationals.Footage verified by the BBC showed Hamas gunmen arriving at the gates of Be'eri on the morning of 7 October - the day Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel.The clip shows them attempting to crawl under the community's gates. When that failed they hide in a booth before ambushing an approaching car, killing the occupants, then entering Be'eri and beginning what would become a day-long attack.Noelle Rapoport, Yoni's mother, said he was ""very much loved"" on the kibbutz, particularly by the older residents.""He never went by without smiling at them, saying hello and helping them,"" she said.The father-of-two was a ""diehard"" Manchester United fan, those who knew him said, and was planning to take his son to their Old Trafford ground for a match next month.""He was so excited to be taking Yosefi with him so it's very heartbreaking now. Yoni will always be with us. He's in my heart and always will be and I just miss him,"" Noelle said.Adam Rapoport, Yoni's brother, described him as a ""great father"" who was a gardener at the kibbutz, and who loved ""the trees and the nature"".He said the family think Yoni was killed when ""the terrorist opened the door of the safe room... he said to his two kids to get under the bed so the terrorist couldn't see them"".Golan Abitol, Yoni's best friend, said it was hard to speak about his friend in the past tense.""He was a gentle person. He was so kind and so loving,"" he said.In a statement shared by the Israeli fan club of Manchester United, Mr Rapoport was said to have ""stood bravely against the inferno"" - but ""couldn't overcome the vile murderers"".It described his ""whole family"" as being ""diehard fans"" and ""veteran club members"" who were planning to visit the club's ground for their upcoming game against Luton Town on 11 November.""Yonatan was excited to take his son Yosefi [to Manchester] for the first time,"" the statement went on, before telling Mr Rapoport's relatives ""the whole community embraces you and shares deeply in your sorrow"".The UK government has said that as well as ""at least"" nine British nationals killed in Hamas's attack, a further seven are missing, some of whom are feared dead or being held hostage in Gaza.The total number of people thought to have been killed in Israel since the fighting broke out earlier this month currently stands at more than 1,400. More than 3,700 people have also died in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes.Roi, 54, is another British citizen to have been confirmed dead in the last few days.His sister Ayelet Svatitzky said her brother was found shot dead at the back of his home, the day after Hamas militants attacked Israel - including her mother's home.Ms Svatitzky's mother, 79-year-old Channah Peri, and her other brother Nadav Popplewell, 51, were abducted by gunmen and have not been seen since, she added.""I'm in utter shock,"" Ms Svatitzky told the BBC, adding that both her mother and surviving brother are diabetic. ""We don't know what kind of conditions they are being held in.""Asked if she hoped her relatives were together, she said: ""In all honesty, I try not to [think about it] because it's just too difficult ... I'm holding Hamas responsible and I think that the international community should hold them responsible and accountable for this.""Of Roi, whose surname has not been disclosed, Ms Svatitzky said: ""I've lost my brother, there's nothing I can do about it. All I can do is bury him.""The stories of UK nationals who have lost their lives due to the Israel-Gaza war are still emerging. You can read more about the people we know have died here.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,16-Oct,"Ido Frommer reaches up high to pull a photo album from a book shelf in his home in southern Israel. The spine reads 2005.""Ah, this is it,"" he says as he begins to leaf through.Some of the pictures show a smiling blond 10-year-old - Ido's son, Avichai. He is photographed on holiday with the rest of the family skiing, or climbing an orange tree, or playing football. In one picture, he is goofing around in a white tutu.""He'll be embarrassed by that photo now,"" Ido says laughing.I can see in his eyes he's very proud of his son, who is now 28. He is on the verge of being deployed to Gaza with the Israeli Defence Forces to fight Hamas, which is proscribed as a terror organisation by the UK, US and other governments.There's also regret in Ido's eyes. He was himself in the military in Gaza in 2005, and backed then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's decision to pull Israeli troops out of the occupied territory allowing the Palestinians to govern themselves.""It was a mistake what we did. What can I say to those 1,500 people that were murdered last week. It wouldn't have happened if we hadn't withdrawn.""I ask him if he feels guilty and his voice cracks as he becomes emotional.""That's a tough word to use,"" he says. ""But maybe it's the right word.""Back in 2005, Ido firmly believed things would be different in Gaza. But the following year the Islamists of Hamas won elections in the territory, sparking a brief civil war with their secular Palestinian rivals, Fatah. Hamas eventually took control. The Islamists had never accepted Israel's right to exist, and continued to attack the Jewish state, firing rockets and kidnapping soldiers and civilians.All this as Israel continued to build on occupied land in the West Bank. Israel later put Gaza under a blockade, and launched a number of ground offensives into the territory. After the recent atrocities by Hamas, troops are poised to go into Gaza once again.When Ido and his son Avichai meet later in the day, there are hugs and slaps on the back. Avichai is all grown up now. His girlfriend is beside him, and he has a closely trimmed blond beard to match the full head of hair I saw in the photographs when he was a boy. His work as an engineer is now on hold, as he prepares to go into Gaza. A handgun sits in a holster on his right thigh.""I remember my father being away from home with the air force, but I never felt he had abandoned us. I knew what he was doing was important.""Now what I have to do is important. There is no higher call, no higher meaning in life, than fighting pure evil. In the 20th Century it was the Nazis. Right now it's Muslim extremists. And we have to fight this ideology, for good to win and liberalism to win and for us to continue living the free life that we want to live.""The Jewish people were supposed to be safe in Israel. They believed there would be no more mass murder if they lived in their own land, after the unbearable trauma of the Holocaust. That's what helped spur the movement for a Jewish homeland at the end of the World War Two.But the Arab world did not accept the new state, with at least 750,000 Palestinians being forced to flee from their homes. Many ended up as refugees in Gaza, to make way for the new country. The legacy of that struggle for land, is what haunts the present day.In Ido's bookcase is another family album, and as he turns the pages he points to the pictures of faces in black and white, staring out, every single one, murdered by the Nazis.""My father is a Holocaust survivor,"" he says.""His whole family was murdered by the Nazis, and we came to Israel and tried to live our life. I've always said what happened back in the 1940s would never happen again. But what we saw last Saturday is very similar. Killing babies, kidnapping people. It's horrible. I'm angry and sad, I'm grieving.""As Avichai prepares to go to war, I ask him what his thoughts are for the innocent Palestinians, who had nothing to do with last week's horrific Hamas attacks, but who will inevitably die as Israel attacks Gaza.""When the British people fought the Nazis in World War Two,"" he says, ""they bombed Dresden and Berlin. It's a hard price, but I will not be extorted into losing 1,500 of my people because the other side is more immoral.""If Hamas wants to prevent civilian Palestinian casualties, it must evacuate Gaza.""A father and son, joined by blood and now war.

BBC,18-Oct,"They call it ""Hamal"" - short for ""war room"" in Hebrew. It sits high in the mountains on the Israel-Lebanon border, at the heart of a complex protected by blast walls.Everything here is about security. There are no windows, and before you can pass through the solid door you have to leave behind mobile phones and smart watches - anything that could give away this secret location.Inside are banks of monitors. Right around the clock, a team of soldiers are gazing at them intently.Each shows grainy black-and-white images from cameras that are constantly trained on more than 100km (62 miles) of Lebanese border. Shifts are normally four hours long, watching the pictures cycle over and over and looking for anything usual.Since Palestinian Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza 11 days ago, killing 1,400 people and taking 199 others hostage, there has been a steady increase in tensions on this border.Almost every day Hezbollah militants from Lebanon have launched anti-tank missiles into Israel, and Israeli forces have responded with artillery, fighter jets and attack helicopters.Both sides have seen civilian deaths this week. Each engagement raises fears that the violence on this border could quickly spiral out of control.Captain ""S"" commands the all-female company watching the cameras. This surveillance job is exclusively done by women.""We are the eyes of the soldiers, the eyes of the forces in the field - of the entire border."" she tells me, ""and we are playing a very important role.""Along one side of the room, childhood photos of each soldier are strung along the wall like bunting. Their dates of birth are written in thick black pen underneath. Each is young, most are still completing their period of compulsory military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).""We are strong women, female soldiers that know their job and mission and know that we play a very important role in this war.""Our goal is first of all to defend, and all the girls know it. Each soldier comes to her shift vigilant and knows her part.""On several occasions over the past week, militants have tried to get across the wall.Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese military and political group backed by Iran, has gradually increased its efforts to infiltrate Israel. Like its staunch ally Hamas, it has been designated a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and others.There are real concerns internationally that any miscalculations here could lead to a new northern front opening up in this war. A major event - like the hospital explosion in Gaza, or the start of a ground offensive there by Israel - could also trigger Hezbollah to take more significant action towards Israel.At some moments, it feels very close. Sergeant ""I"" was on duty, watching her monitor, when the images on it suddenly changed.As shadowy figures approached the border wall, she knew what to do. Quickly, she called in an air strike.""I recognised a group of terrorists on the screens and understood that something was wrong. This is my job, to protect the northern border so that no one will penetrate and no civilians will get hurt, especially those who live here by the border.""""It's scary, and it's stressful, but I have to keep it cool. I won't lie, it's very scary to stand here by the border. With everything that's happening nowadays in our country, it's very difficult to process all that's happened.""For Sergeant ""I"", it's especially difficult. Young female soldiers doing exactly the same job in the south were targeted by Hamas.""I think of all the forces and the camera observers who were caught up in the attack there. My heart goes out to them. I personally know a lot of people who were abducted or murdered.""© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,17-Oct,"Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was.""Every Hamas member is a dead man,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after fighters from the militant group killed 1,400 people in a brutal attack on Israel.The goal of Operation Swords of Iron appears far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before and could last months. But is its aim realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil it?A ground invasion of the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to the civilian population. Air strikes have already claimed 3,000 lives, according to Gaza officials, and more than a million people have fled their homes.Israel's military has the added task of rescuing at least 199 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza.Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), has vowed to ""dismantle"" Hamas, and has singled out its political head in Gaza. But is there an ultimate vision for how Gaza will look after 16 years of Hamas's violent rule?""I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,"" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. ""But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities.""That might be a more realistic objective. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed.Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, says destroying or weakening Hamas would be highly complicated. Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, the militant group has another 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says.IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said by the end of this war Hamas should no longer have the military capacity to ""threaten or kill Israeli civilians"".The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, will have prepared for an Israeli offensive. Explosive devices will have been set, and ambushes planned. It can use its notorious and extensive network of tunnels to attack Israeli forces.In 2014, Israeli infantry battalions suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines, snipers and ambushes, while hundreds of civilians died in fighting in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza City.That is one reason Israel has demanded the evacuation of the northern half of the Gaza Strip to the south of the Wadi Gaza river.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty.The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign without international pressure to pull back.Gaza is rapidly becoming a ""hell hole"", the UN's refugee agency has warned. The death toll is rising fast; water, power and fuel supplies have been cut off.""The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders. The philosophy is 'let's mobilise, we have plenty of time',"" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in if they see images of people starving. Pressure will also mount when civilians are killed on the ground.""It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,"" says Mr Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.President Emmanuel Macron has promised French-Israeli families to bring their loved ones home: ""France will never abandon its children.""The extent to which the fate of the hostages will influence military planners is unclear.French strategic specialist Col Michel Goya said the IDF have a straightforward choice, either of sparing the hostages' lives, or going in to ""do Hamas as much harm as possible"".Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are also ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders.Amir Bar Shalom, from Israel's Army Radio, compares the situation to the 1972 Munich Olympics, when Palestinian gunman seized Israeli athletes and killed 11 people.An operation was launched to find and kill everyone involved in the attack and he believes the government will want to hunt down all those behind the kidnappings.In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. But Israel will think twice before another big prisoner release, because one of the men freed in that swap was Yahya Sinwar, who has since become Hamas's political leader in Gaza.What could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point. Dozens of trucks carrying humanitarian aid are stuck near Rafah with no sign yet of them being able to go through. Nor is it possible for Palestinians with foreign passports to leave.""The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,"" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai or acting militarily against Israel on their behalf.Jordan's King Abdullah has also talked of a ""red line"" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: ""No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,"" he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny.So far there have been several deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, but they have not amounted to a new front against Israel.Iran, Hezbollah's main sponsor, is already threatening to launch ""new fronts"" against Israel. They were the focus of US President Joe Biden's warning, when he said: ""To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!""Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place.Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and will have no intention to return as an occupying force.Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA, which is not a militant group, currently controls parts of the West Bank.Egypt would also welcome a more pragmatic neighbour, he argues.Persuading the PA to return would be highly complicated as it is weak even in the West Bank, says Mr Milstein, who warns that the risk of solving one problem is in finding 10 new ones.Another option might be to create an administration, run by the heads of clans, non-governmental organisations, and with involvement from Egypt, he suggests.Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Even before Hamas's atrocities in Israel there were tight restrictions on ""dual-use goods"" entering Gaza that could have a military as well as a civilian role. Israel will want to impose even heavier restrictions.There have been calls for a wide buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. A former head of its Shin Bet security service, Yoram Cohen, believes a 2km (1.25-mile) ""shoot-on-sight"" zone will be needed to replace the existing zone.Whatever the outcome of the war, Israel will want to ensure a similar attack never happens again.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,17-Oct,"More than 100 Palestinians have been killed in air strikes in southern Gaza, officials say, as the Israeli military continues to target the area despite ordering civilians to shelter there.Most of the dead reportedly fled their homes in the north ahead of what is expected to be a major ground offensive against the militant group Hamas.The military said it struck a series of Hamas targets in the south.There is also mounting concern about humanitarian conditions in Gaza.The US said it had agreed to develop a plan with Israel that would enable aid to reach civilians in the Hamas-governed territory, as UN aid agencies warned that hospitals' fuel supplies were unlikely to last more than 24 hours, water was extremely limited and shops only had a few days of food left.There have been hopes of opening Egypt's Rafah crossing to let lorryloads of urgently needed aid in and Palestinians with foreign passports out. But an Israeli strike reportedly damaged a building at the crossing on Monday.Israel cut electricity and most water and stopped deliveries of food and medicine through its crossings in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas militants on 7 October in which at least 1,300 people were killed and 199 others taken hostage.Around 3,000 people have been killed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza since then, according to health officials.This video can not be playedWatch: 'Where would we go?' - the families staying in Gaza CityThe BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf in Khan Younis says that what happened overnight in southern Gaza is very worrying for the hundreds of thousands of people who have complied with last Friday's order from the Israeli military to evacuate northern Gaza for their ""own safety"".Local officials in Khan Younis said three Israeli air strikes left more than 100 people dead, most of whom were displaced.Amin Hneideq said his daughter was wounded by a bomb that destroyed a nearby home and killed a family who had fled southwards. ""They brought them from the north just to strike them in the south,"" he told Reuters news agency.The Israeli military said on Tuesday morning that it had struck operational command centres, military infrastructure with operatives inside, and hideouts belonging to Hamas in Khan Younis and Rafah, to the south, as well as two northern areas.Later, it announced that a strike had killed a top Hamas military commander, Ayman Nofal, who it described as ""one of the most dominant figures in the terrorist organisation"". Hamas said he died in a strike in Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.Many displaced people in Khan Younis told the BBC that they were planning to pack up their belongings and return to their homes.One man said he had been sleeping in the street for the last couple of days, and that he would prefer to die in dignity than to die from thirst.Khan Younis, Rafah and other southern communities have been overwhelmed by the need to accommodate and feed more than 600,000 displaced people. Another 400,000 people have sought shelter elsewhere in the Strip.""Every day it's a daily mission for everyone to go to find things to feed their children,"" filmmaker Yousef Hammash told BBC Radio 5 Live, adding that everyone was suffering extreme stress and were existing in ""survival mode"".Some water was brought to Khan Younis from a store in Gaza City on Tuesday, which was risky because there was no guarantee the lorries would not be targeted by Israeli forces.The UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said Israel opened one line of water to southern Gaza for three hours on Monday, but that only 14% of the Strip's 2.2 million population were able to benefit.Gaza's last functioning seawater desalination plant was also forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel, increasing concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases.The hospital in Khan Younis, which has been struggling to treat some of the 12,500 people so far wounded in air strikes, said it would run out of fuel for its back-up generators at midnight, placing the lives of patients at serious risk.People have been trying to secure additional fuel at local petrol stations and companies, which would allow the hospital to keep functioning.The World Food Programme also said that food shops in Gaza had just four or five days of supplies left. It added that there might be a few days' more in warehouses, but the Israeli strikes were making access very difficult.Despite such warnings, an Israeli military spokesman insisted that ""there is no humanitarian crisis right now in Gaza"".""We do not have the commitment to supply Hamas electricity,"" Lt Col Richard Hecht told BBC Newsnight.""People who attacked us, they've been in control for multiple years already in the Gaza Strip. They have electricity... I also see water in the south of Gaza.""The UN human rights office meanwhile said Israel's order for 1.1 million civilians to evacuate, combined with the imposition of its ""complete siege"" on Gaza, could constitute the ""forcible transfer of civilians in violation of international law"".A spokeswoman also said reports of attacks on civilians attempting to flee had to be investigated independently and warned that ""we cannot have collective punishment of an entire population because of an attack by militants.""She appealed again for Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups to immediately and unconditionally release all of the hostages being held in Gaza and to stop firing indiscriminate rockets at Israeli cities and towns.This video can not be playedWatch: 'Bring my baby back home' says mother of Israeli-French hostageOvernight, Hamas released a video of a 21-year-old Israeli-French woman, Mia Shem, who said she was captured at a music festival where at least 260 other partygoers were massacred.On Tuesday, her mother Keren told a news conference: ""I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home. She only went to a party to have some fun. And now she's in Gaza and she's not the only one.""There are babies and children and old people, Holocaust survivors, who were kidnapped... This is a crime against humanity.""In a separate development, the Israeli military said it had carried out new strikes on targets belonging to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in response to cross-border anti-tank missile fire.Troops also killed four militants who attempted to infiltrate Israeli territory and plant an explosive device, it added.The Israeli military and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire almost daily since Hamas's attack, raising fears of a regional war.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,28-Sep,"In the dark after midnight, it was like rush hour in the northern Gaza Strip.Thousands of Palestinian workers had heard that Israel was to open its side of the Erez crossing at dawn after 12 days of closure in response to renewed violent protests by the separation fence with Israel in the east of the impoverished territory.It was the news that Amjad Hassan, a builder who is the sole breadwinner for 13 relatives had been praying for. ""We work on a daily wage, if we don't work, we don't feed our families,"" he explained.A father-of-five, Nabil said the crossing closure had been ""the greatest disaster"" for him, as he accrued a large debt to the middleman who had arranged his Israeli permit while he was unable to work to pay it off. He had feared losing his coveted permit altogether.Some 18,000 Gazans are currently authorised to work in Israel, giving them respite from the dire economic situation at home. Dramatic photographs showed many waiting at the crossing point overnight. Some slept in corridors, on the floor, even on a baggage scanner in a reception hall belonging to Hamas, the Islamist militant group which governs Gaza.After a period of relative calm in Gaza, demonstrations restarted along its boundary fence earlier this month, with hundreds of young Palestinians turning out most days to confront Israeli soldiers. The rallies have been approved, even encouraged, by Hamas.Protesters have burnt tyres, thrown stones and explosive devices, and released incendiary balloons and kites into southern Israel, which have set fire to farmland and scared Israeli communities living nearby. Some have shot at soldiers, the Israeli military says. It has responded with tear gas and live fire.One Palestinian at the fence was shot dead by Israeli forces and on another occasion, six were killed, apparently by a malfunctioning Palestinian explosive device.At one point earlier this week, the Israeli military responded to what it called the ""violent riots"" using a drone, helicopter, and tank to hit several targets in Gaza, including Hamas militant posts. There were no reports of any casualties.Hamas says that young Palestinians have organised events in response to the tough living conditions in Gaza, which has been under a tight Israeli-Egyptian blockade for the past 16 years, since the group took over the territory. It suggests they have also been motivated by Israeli actions in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the BBC that it was ""a unified picture of a national struggle in all arenas"".For Omar Shaban, a political economist in Gaza, it is no surprise to see young people turning out by the perimeter fence.""The situation in Gaza is boiling,"" he says. ""People who go to the border are frustrated by the lack of opportunity. Two thirds of Gazans are aged under 30, who don't have jobs and they can't travel and so they express their anger.""However, for many Palestinians the demonstrations bring back painful memories of the Hamas orchestrated weekly mass protests between 2018 and 2019, known as the ""Great March of Return"".Back then, Israeli snipers killed more than 300 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry. Thousands more were injured - with hundreds losing their limbs after being shot. Israel's military said it opened fire at people trying to infiltrate its territory.On TikTok, powerful videos have been put up by Gazans who were maimed in the earlier rallies and are now urging young people not to go to the new ones.One amputee claims he was deceived by the organisers five years ago. ""Whenever they feel that people are against them, they rush to send them to the border to vent their anger away from them,"" he says. ""We have nothing in this country. They are the ones making money and we are losing our limbs.""With the renewal of the protests, albeit on a small-scale, there is a perception that Hamas has been trying to distract attention from its own economic woes but also to gain leverage in indirect talks with Israel, being led by Egypt, Qatar, and the UN.A senior official, familiar with the negotiations, told the BBC that ahead of the Erez crossing (also known as Beit Hanoun) opening for Palestinian workers, an agreement was reached to stop the demonstrations for two weeks.However, there are difficult outstanding issues to resolve as Hamas struggles to balance its practical responsibilities as a governing power in Gaza, in the midst of a deep financial crisis, while sticking to its militant ideology.Just before the unrest by the fence restarted, Hamas announced that it was slashing the wages of its civil servants by half. Recently, Qatar, which helps pay the salaries under the terms of previous ceasefire understandings with Israel, has sent less money, for which Hamas blames Israel.As part of the indirect talks with Hamas, Israel is understood to be offering more economic privileges if the group freezes its military activities - including carrying out attacks on Israelis in the West Bank.This follows two shootings last month which killed three Israelis in Hawara and Hebron. On both occasions, Hamas went beyond expressing general support - its usual response - to claim that members of its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, were responsible.Israeli military commentator Or Heller says there has also been a significant increase in weapons and improvised explosive devices being transferred by Hamas to operatives in the West Bank, which is partly governed by its rivals in the Palestinian Authority.""We are always seeing with Hamas efforts to maintain relative quiet in 'Hamas-stan', 'the state of Hamas' [in Gaza], and to export the terrorism to the West Bank,"" he notes.Up to now, Hamas has been refusing to make commitments connected to the West Bank, the BBC understands.At a military ceremony on Wednesday, Israel's Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that Israel was ready to step up its actions against Hamas in Gaza if necessary, referring to what happened in an Israeli offensive which lasted five days in May and decimated the leadership of a smaller militant group, Islamic Jihad.""We don't want an escalation [in fighting] and are not looking for a fight, but if we get to the point where we need to act, let 'Operation Shield and Arrow' from a few months ago be a reminder and an example for all terror groups about the capabilities of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], Israel and its security apparatus,"" Mr Gallant said.During the May operation, some 33 people were killed in Gaza - including at least 12 civilians - and two civilians in Israel, one of whom was a Palestinian labourer.Back at the Erez crossing, there has been a scramble with Palestinian workers trying to make it out through the rigorous security checks to return to their jobs inside Israel. The crossing is due to temporarily close again this weekend due to the Jewish Sukkot holiday.The Israeli military's co-ordinator for the Palestinian Territories issued only a brief statement about its intentions. It read: ""Continuation of the civil measures will be possible in accordance with security assessments and with the preservation of stable security.""Amid the continuing uncertainty, the workers say they are just focusing on support for their loved ones. ""Now my younger brothers can breathe a sigh of relief,"" says Amjad, the builder, ""our lives have been on hold.""© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,13-Oct,"Israel appears to be preparing for a ground invasion into Gaza.Its military is telling 1.1 million people in the north of the strip to relocate south in the next 24 hours. Meanwhile it is massing tens of thousands of troops, tanks and artillery on the edge of the territory.But sending ground forces into Gaza's densely populated urban areas is an operation fraught with peril.The scope of a potential ground assault is also still not clear - how far would the incursion go and for how long?The choreography necessary for a ground assault has started.Major General Amos Gilead, a veteran of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and previous operations inside Gaza, says the first task for Israel was to create a unity government to get public backing for what happens next.Recent high level diplomatic visits by senior US and European politicians have allowed Israel to shore up international support, though that solidarity could waver the longer this war goes on and as civilian casualties mount. Significant Israeli military casualties in any military operation will also test its own resolve.As for military preparations, Israel has already massed its forces near the border with Gaza. Some 300,000 reservists have been activated, alongside a standing force of more than 160,000.We talked to some of the recently arrived reservists in the south - their morale appears to be high, and they're ready to fight.Nissim was in Sri Lanka when he first heard the news of the Hamas attack, but took the first plane back to Israel to join his unit. ""This is our home. We have to fight for it,"" he says.Shuki left his sales job straight away. ""We would love to have peace,"" he told me. ""Unfortunately, that's not possible. We enjoy life, so we need to fight for the right to live.""Israel seems united in the need for action, but the clock is ticking while they await their battle orders. The longer troops wait, the harder it will be to maintain readiness and morale.Israel's warning to Palestinians living in Gaza to flee south is an indication that the next phase of its military operation is imminent.Israel's first task was to secure its own territory and to kill, or capture and interrogate Hamas fighters who crossed the border and killed more than 1,300 people and kidnapped at least 150.Israel's already been conducting intense air strikes targeting Hamas' military hierarchy and infrastructure. Over the past six days its air force has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza. As a comparison, Nato allies released 7,700 during the entire war in Libya in 2011.More than 1,500 people have been killed in Gaza in the air strikes so far.Plans for the invasion itself will be a closely guarded secret, but Israel has been getting ready for years. It's been training troops in a multi-million dollar urban warfare centre in the south, dubbed mini-Gaza.There they have learnt how to fight through a maze of tightly packed buildings and tunnels, of which Hamas is believed to have built more than 1,000.Yaakov Katz, a former editor of the Jerusalem Post and the author of several books on Israel's military, says the military has been configured to operate for this very purpose in specialist brigades - combining engineers with armoured bulldozers working alongside tanks and infantry.Major General Yaakov Amidror - a former IDF commander and national security advisor - acknowledges that fighting Hamas will be tough. Hamas will have laid booby traps and Improvised Explosive Devices at entrance points and along narrow streets, he says.Israel believes Hamas has around 30,000 troops. Their weapons include automatic rifles, rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles - some of Russian origin like Kornets and Fagots.Hamas also still has large stockpiles of rockets which they've been firing into Israel. Yaakov Katz says Hamas has also been producing its own small drones - including suicide ones. He says Hamas may also have a very limited supply of short-range shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles. What they do not have is armoured vehicles, tanks and artillery - unlike Israel.But the challenge for Israel will be close-quarters fighting in densely populated urban areas.Israel has specialists teams for tunnel warfare, including an engineering unit called Yahalom, and Oketz which specialises in canine combat.Mr Katz says Israeli troops will avoid going into tunnels unless they have to, not least because Hamas will know them better. Instead tunnels will be destroyed by pouring down explosives.The fate of the hostages taken from Israel complicates any ground assault.Maj Gen Gilead was involved in the negotiations which eventually led to the release of an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas for five years from 2006 to 2011. He was eventually exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.Maj Gen Gilead says while the military will need to take their fate into consideration, ""if we don't do something concrete, we might find ourselves with more challenging problems"".But Maj Gen Amidror says the hostages will not prevent any action. ""We will fight Hamas to the end and we will have to find those hostages during the operation.""Israel's stated goal is to destroy Hamas.Maj Gen Gilead, who served in the IDF for 30 years, says that goes beyond previous Israeli operations inside Gaza, which were ""mainly about containment"".This time he says ""we need to do something far more dramatic"". Decisive military action he believes would also deter Israel's other enemies in the region - namely Hezbollah and Iran.Mr Katz believes Israel's goals will be more pragmatic - making sure that Hamas never has the military capability to attack Israel again. He says Israel ""doesn't want to re-occupy Gaza, and have to take care of two million people who are hostile to it"".However, recent history suggests invasions very rarely go according to plan.Even the world's most advanced militaries can soon get bogged down - look at what happened to the US in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more recently Russia in Ukraine.A military operation inside Gaza, which is only 25 miles (40 km) long, is not on that scale, but the outcome is far from clear, says Lieutenant General Sir Tom Beckett of the Institute of Strategic Studies.""In truth, there are no good options for an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza. No matter how successful the operation proves in defeating Hamas as a military organisation, Hamas's political imperative and the population's support for the resistance will continue.""Israel either reoccupies Gaza to control it or, by withdrawing after an offensive, cedes ground to people for whom the resistance is existence.""Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

BBC,11-Oct,"This video can not be playedVideo from the scene shows a man climbing the building to remove the Israeli flagProtesters have removed Israeli flags flying above two South Yorkshire town halls.Footage shared on social media showed a man on the roof of Sheffield Town Hall on Tuesday, removing the banner and replacing it with a Palestinian flag.The flag outside Rotherham Town Hall was also ""forcibly"" removed and the flag pole damaged, the council said.South Yorkshire's mayor Oliver Coppard condemned the acts, saying they did not ""reflect the values of the region"".In a statement South Yorkshire Police said it believed two men had scaled Sheffield Town Hall on Tuesday evening.In the clip, shared by Sheffield Online, people could be heard shouting ""take it down"" and cheering as the Israeli flag was lowered in Sheffield.Officers attempted to disperse crowds, with two suspects ""fleeing the scene"" during the ""minor disorder"".No arrests had been made, a force spokesperson added.The force confirmed it had also received reports of the theft of a flag and ""minor damage"" to a flagpole at Rotherham Town Hall and investigations into both incidents were ""ongoing"".They happened three days after dozens of armed fighters from Hamas - the Palestinian militant group - crossed into Israel from Gaza in a surprise attack.The death toll in Israel has reached 1,200 - while more than 900 people have been killed by retaliatory Israeli air strikes on Gaza.Sheffield City Council leader Tom Hunt said: ""Everyone has the right to safe and peaceful protest but we cannot support the events that took place during the protest outside Sheffield's Town Hall.""Protesters put themselves and others in serious danger.""The decision to fly the Israeli flag was made after a request from central government, both Sheffield City Council and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council said.The local authorities added that the ""show of solidarity"" had been due to end at 20:00 BST, with the Union flag put back on the buildings afterwards.Sheffield City Council confirmed a ""full review"" of the incident would take place and ""we will look at the security measures that were in place"".Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council said it had reported the incident to South Yorkshire Police.Discussing the actions of those who were on the roof in Sheffield, Mr Hunt added: ""We are a city of sanctuary, and this is not what we stand for.""There are strong feelings about the situation in Israel and Palestine but we ask everyone to show respect and tolerance at this time.""Meanwhile, Sheffield South East MP Clive Betts told the BBC the incident was ""disappointing"".He added: ""I absolutely and utterly condemn the Hamas attack on innocent people.""We have to look for long-term solutions to stop this violence. It's a two-state solution - but we don't seem to get anywhere near it.""South Yorkshire's mayor Oliver Coppard said the Israeli flag being removed from the council buildings did not ""reflect the values of the region I know"".""We are a place of compassion, a place that supports and respects our minority communities, and a place where we respect each other,"" he said.Mr Coppard shared his plans to work with faith and community leaders as well as the police to ""bring together our communities"" and ""to help us move forward"".He added: ""We will do so in solidarity with the people of Israel, and those at risk in Gaza, those grieving, worried for their loved ones, and those scared about what is to come.""Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

BBC,10-Oct,"This video can not be playedWatch: Hiding at home, blinded and choked by dust - a video diary from Gaza""Where do we go? Is there a safe place left in this neighbourhood, which was so quiet and beautiful?"" residents of an apartment block in Rimal asked me, with heavy sarcasm.I had just spent the most difficult seven hours of my life inside there, as Israeli warplanes carried another wave of air strikes in retaliation for the Palestinian militant group's unprecedented assault on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on Saturday.The Israeli strikes also caused significant damage to dozens of residential buildings, the offices of telecommunications companies, and faculty buildings of the Islamic University of Gaza.Terrifying explosions shook the area throughout Monday night. Children were screaming and nobody had a moment's sleep.It was a night that the residents of Rimal - Gaza City's wealthiest neighbourhood and usually its quietest - will not forget for a long time.As dawn broke on Tuesday, the intensity of the strikes decreased and people discovered the extent of the destruction. The south-western neighbourhood's infrastructure was severely damaged and most roads leading to it were cut off.As I drove around it felt as if there had been an earthquake. There was rubble, shattered glass and severed wiring everywhere. Such was the devastation that I did not recognise some of the buildings that I passed.This video can not be playedDrone footage shows Gaza neighbourhoods flattened""I lost everything. My apartment, where my five children lived, was here in this building. My grocery shop below the building was destroyed,"" Mohammed Abu al-Kass told me while carrying his daughter Shahd in the street.""Where do we go? We have become homeless. There is no shelter for us anymore or work.""""Are my house and my grocery shop a military target, Israel?"" he added, accusing the Israeli military of lying when it says it does not target civilians.The Palestinian health ministry said that about 300 people, two thirds of them civilians, were killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza on Monday. It was the deadliest day there for many years.At least 15 people were killed in the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp, north-east of Gaza City, in the afternoon. The Israeli military said it targeted the home of a Hamas commander. But many people at a nearby market or in neighbouring houses were killed.This video can not be playedWatch: Footage from BBC Arabic inside the Jabalia refugee camp after an Israeli airstrikeThe overall death toll in Gaza since Saturday now stands at 900, including 260 children, according to the health ministry. Another 4,500 people have been injured.The already dire humanitarian crisis in this tiny, overcrowded territory also deepens.Its 2.2 million residents are running out of food, fuel, electricity and water, after Israel's government ordered a ""complete siege"" and cut off all of Gaza's supplies in response to Hamas's attack.Saturday's unexpected assault has killed 1,000 people on the Israeli side, and between 100 and 150 hostages have been taken across the border into Gaza by the militants.""Can you imagine that we are living without power or water in the 21st Century? My baby has run out of nappies and there is only half a bottle of milk left,"" said Waad al-Mughrabi as she looked at the destroyed building next to her home in Rimal.""Was it my child who attacked Israel?""Outside Gaza's largest supermarket, which had opened for the first time since Saturday, dozens of people were queuing in front of a small back door. They were hoping to buy whatever provisions they could, fearful that the fighting will last a long time.Most of Gaza's fresh vegetables and fruits are grown in the south of the territory, and the severe fuel shortage means that transporting them to the north will become increasingly difficult.So far, there have been no deliveries of food or other essential goods from Egypt, which has maintained a tight blockade of Gaza for security reasons, along with Israel, since Hamas took over the territory in 2007.People have also been unable to flee Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Only 400 a day are usually allowed in or out, but Israeli air strikes on Monday and Tuesday hit an entry gate on the Palestinian side, stopping any crossings, the Palestinian interior ministry in Gaza said.That has forced most of the 200,000 people who have fled their homes to take shelter in UN-run schools. Some have fled in fear, while others have seen their homes destroyed by air strikes.Some Gazans are choosing to shelter in basements, but they risk being trapped inside if the building above collapses. About 30 families were trapped in one basement alone on Monday night.""In previous wars, this part of the city was a safe haven for residents of areas on the border [with Israel],"" said Rimal resident Mohammed al-Mughrabi.The Israeli strikes on Monday night showed that nowhere is safe anymore.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,24-Feb,"Every day, trains laden with potentially harmful materials, like the one that derailed in East Palestine this month, rumble through American towns and cities. Often, residents are unaware of the danger.Environmental experts warn that without stricter regulation from Congress and increased transparency requirements for dangerous materials passing through residential areas, many more towns and cities will be left in the dark and unprepared, as East Palestine was before a 3 February derailment unleashed a toxic onslaught on the town.""Millions of people deal with it every single day, they probably just don't know it,"" says David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment.""The potential for a catastrophic train derailment and fire or explosions has been high, it's certainly been something experts have warned about for many, many years"".The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which regulates the industry, does not provide lists of the rail lines that hazardous materials travel, according to an agency spokesperson.Railroad companies are loathe to disclose much information about hazardous cargo and routes the material travels, citing security concerns. Local governments can request information from the railroads annually for the purpose of planning their emergency response.One of the people left in the dark was Ohio's own governor.Norfolk Southern had not notified officials that vinyl chloride and other hazardous materials would be winding its way along the tracks that ran through East Palestine the day of the disaster, said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine.""This train apparently was not considered a high-hazardous material train, therefore the railroad was not required to notify anyone here in Ohio about what was in the rail cars coming through our state,"" Mr DeWine said at a 14 February press conference.""If this is true … this is absurd, we need to look at this. Congress needs to take a look at how these things are handled.""At a tense town hall on 15 February, East Palestine's residents expressed frustration at the lack of knowledge about the risk that passed through their backyards each day.""I wouldn't know what to say if anything could have prevented this, because there's never no information about trains that are going through this town,"" said Wes Durkis, a local maintenance worker. ""My whole life, they just come and go, and we don't know.""Freight trains are used to carry materials both innocuous and hazardous over long distances.An expansive network of Class-1 railroads, which are operated by the major railroad freight companies and one passenger company, wind their way through America's coasts, heartlands and metropolises each day, racking up millions upon millions of miles every year.Many of them carry potentially flammable or toxic substances, like crude oil or petrochemicals.About a thousand train derailments occur in the US each year, according to the FRA. Leaks from trains carrying hazardous materials happen rarely. Only nine such incidents occurred in 2022, according to FRA data. The year with the highest number of hazardous material releases, 2020, only saw 20 such incidents.But accidents do happen, and when they occur, they can devastate a community.In 2005, a Norfolk Southern train carrying pressurized chlorine gas crashed in Graniteville, South Carolina, sending a toxic plume over the town. Nine people were killed in the crash and thousands had to evacuate.A year later, the town's residents told The Washington Post they still suffered consequences from the fallout.In 2012, a train carrying vinyl chloride - the same chemical primarily involved in the East Palestine incident - derailed in Paulsboro, New Jersey. Cars containing the substance derailed off a bridge and released 23,000 gallons of the chemical.In 2015, a train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in the state of West Virginia, destroying a house and contaminating the local drinking water.North American rail tragedies were not limited to the US. In 2013, a train carrying oil derailed and exploded in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic, Quebec, killing 47 people and forcing 2,000 residents to evacuate.In many circumstances, local emergency responders were not prepared to deal with a chemical spill or explosion due to a lack of knowledge about the substances passing through their communities, a ProPublica investigation into railroads used to transport oil found. Emergency managers throughout the US told the investigative outlet that they did not receive notifications about dangerous materials traveling by rail.Given that these freight lines run through major US cities, as well as small towns like East Palestine, millions of Americans are potentially at risk, environmental experts said.In Pennsylvania alone, 3.9 million people lived within the evacuation zone of trains carrying crude oil, a study conducted by PennEnvironment found in 2015. That included hundreds of thousands of people in the Philadelphia metro region.Any changes to railroad regulations would require the federal government to act; states and cities do not have much power to regulate the rail industry because it operates across state lines.After the accident, East Palestine's residents are hyper-aware of the trains that have resumed passage through their town. And they know just as little about what the carriages carry as they did before the disaster, they say.""The day they lifted the evacuation, there were trains going through in the background carrying the same thing,"" said Lisa Hamner, a frustrated East Palestine resident whose business sits just meters from the derailment site.""What's the next town going to be? It's sad.""Bernd Debusmann Jr contributed to this report.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,15-Feb,"Anxious residents are still demanding answers nearly two weeks after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in the small Ohio town of East Palestine.""It's pretty dramatic right now,"" said James Figley, who lives just blocks from the derailment site. ""The whole town's in an uproar.""Mr Figley, a 63-year-old graphic designer, was sitting on his sofa on the night of 3 February when he heard the horrifying sound of metal screeching to a halt. He and his wife got in the car to investigate, and discovered a hellish scene.""There were a series of explosions, continuing, and the smell was getting to be horrendous,"" Mr Figley said.""If you ever burn plastic in your backyard, and [get] that black smoke? That was it,"" he said. ""It was black, just black. You could tell it was a chemical smell. Burning your eyes. It could get really bad if you were downwind.""Fires sprung up from the accident, panicking residents who lived just blocks away.Days later, a toxic pillar of smoke towered over the town, as officials burned off a dangerous chemical known as vinyl chloride before it could explode.Over the next few days, dead fish appeared in the creeks - thousands of them, officials later confirmed. People nearby told local media that their chickens died suddenly, their foxes panicked, and their pets fell ill. Residents complained of headaches, burning eyes and sore throats.Governor Mike DeWine said on Wednesday that while air quality in the town was safe, residents near the site of the toxic spill should drink bottled water as a precaution. State and federal officials have assured residents they were removing contaminated soil from the site, and the air and municipal water quality was now normal.The disconnect between what some residents have reported, and the assurances that officials continue to issue, has led to confusion and fear in East Palestine. Meanwhile, a mixture of environmental and health experts have questioned whether the site is truly safe, and social media sleuths have claimed that officials are not telling residents the whole story, despite government officials' frequent updates and ire at the railroad company.Some locals have welcomed the extra scrutiny.""There's way too much we don't know,"" Mr Figley said.Officials have provided some details about the Norfolk Southern train that derailed on 3 February on its way to Pennsylvania.The train hauled about 150 freight carriages, 50 of which were hit by the crash, Mr DeWine said at a press conference on Tuesday. About 10 of them carried potentially toxic materials.An exact cause for the derailment has not yet been determined by the US National Transportation Safety Board, but they said that it may have been related to a mechanical issue on one of the car axles.Its cars were carrying, among other substances, vinyl chloride, a colourless, hazardous gas that is used to make PVC plastic and vinyl products.Vinyl chloride is also a known carcinogen. Acute exposure to the chemical is linked to dizziness, drowsiness and headaches, whereas prolonged exposure can cause liver damage and a rare form of liver cancer.On 6 February, after evacuating the immediate area, officials conducted a controlled burn of the vinyl chloride. Federal, state and railroad experts concluded it would be safer than allowing the material to explode and send shrapnel flying through the town, Mr DeWine said, calling it a choice between ""two bad options"".The controlled burn spawned an apocalyptic plume of smoke over East Palestine. The images went viral on social media, with many shocked observers likening it to a disaster film.Days later, Mr DeWine, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Norfolk Southern declared the burn a success, and residents were allowed to return once officials had deemed it safe.""For us, when they said it was all clear, we decided it was OK to come back,"" said East Palestine resident John Myers, who lives with his family in a house near the derailment site.He said he had not experienced any negative side effects. ""The air smells like it always does,"" he said.On Tuesday, the US Environmental Protection Agency said that it had not detected any significant levels of hazardous substances in the air. The agency has screened nearly 400 homes so far, it said, and did not detect any chemicals, though they are continuing to examine more homes in the area and conduct air quality monitoring.After the accident, the EPA did find traces of chemicals in water samples nearby, including the Ohio River. Those contaminated waters, the agency said, had entered storm drains. Ohio officials have offered to test concerned residents' water supply or drill new wells if requested.By Wednesday, Ohio's state Environmental Protection Agency assured residents that wells feeding the local water systems tested free of chemicals from the derailment, and the municipal water supply was safe to drink.For some, it has been hard to reconcile the alarming images of a toxic plume with the all-clear the government recently gave East Palestine.Social media users, particularly on Twitter and TikTok, have fixated on reports of harmed animals and images of the vinyl chloride burn, demanding more answers from officials.After people posted videos of dead fish to social media, officials acknowledged the phenomenon was real. Around 3,500 fish of 12 different species had died after the crash across 7.5 miles of streams south of East Palestine, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources said.However, officials said they had not received reports that the derailment or chemical burn had led directly to the deaths of livestock or other terrestrial animals.Residents in the immediate area have complained of headaches and nausea more than a week after the chemicals were burned, according to reports in the Washington Post, New Republic and local media outlets.Environmental experts told the BBC they had misgivings about the government's decision to allow people to return to East Palestine so soon after the crash and controlled burn.""It certainly feels like state and local regulators moved too quickly to give the green light to people to go back,"" said David Masur, executive director of the PennEnvironment Research & Policy Center.""That builds a lot of distrust and scepticism from the public about trusting these agencies, which is a problem,"" he said.In addition to vinyl chloride, several of the other substances on the train could form dangerous compounds when burned, such as dioxin, said Peter DeCarlo, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies air pollution.""That, as an atmospheric chemist, is something I would want to steer very, very, very clear of,"" he said, adding that he wanted the EPA to release more detailed data about the air quality.At least four class-action lawsuits have been filed by East Palestine residents against Norfolk Southern railway, alleging they have been exposed to toxic substances and have suffered ""severe emotional distress"" as a result of the derailment.""A lot of our clients are really considering… possibly moving away from the area,"" said Hunter Miller, an attorney representing East Palestine residents Ray and Judith Hall in a class-action suit against the railroad.""This is supposed to be their safe haven, their happy place, their home,"" Mr Miller said. ""And now they feel like their home has been infiltrated, that they're not so sure that this is a safe haven anymore.""On Tuesday, a reporter asked Mr DeWine if he would personally feel safe returning home if he lived in East Palestine.""I would be alert and concerned,"" Mr DeWine said. ""But I think I would probably be back in my house.""This video can not be playedWatch: Anger erupts at Ohio train crash town meeting© 2023 BBC.

BBC,21-Sep,"Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince has said ""every day we get closer"" to normalising ties with Israel.A deal between the two powers would mark a huge regional shift.But in a rare interview with Fox News, Mohammed bin Salman stressed the Palestinian issue was still a ""very important"" part of US-brokered talks.As part of the negotiation process, the Wall Street Journal said Israeli and US officials were working on a plan that could see Riyadh openly enrich uranium.Enriched uranium can be used to make nuclear reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who has previously warned about the dangers of a Middle Eastern nuclear arms race - has not publicly responded to that article.The Fox News interview aired shortly after Mr Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden met on the side-lines of the UN General Assembly in New York.They also spoke positively about the chances of a breakthrough that would see Israel and Saudi Arabia establishing diplomatic relations for the first time. The US is a close ally of both countries.An Israeli official statement said the meeting in New York ""mostly dealt with ways to establish an historic peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which could greatly advance an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict"".Israel's Foreign Minister, Eli Cohen, later said that a framework deal could be in place by early next year. ""The gaps can be bridged,"" Mr Cohen told Israel's Army Radio. ""It will take time. But there is progress.""The Biden administration hopes such a timeframe would enable it to clinch ratification in the US Congress - where many, particularly in the president's own Democratic Party, are critical of Saudi Arabia's human rights record. It would then have a significant foreign policy achievement to show ahead of November's US presidential election.Like most Arab countries, Saudi Arabia has held off from recognising Israel out of solidarity with the Palestinians.However, since late last year, the US has been trying to bring about a breakthrough that would build on the so-called Abraham Accords mediated by the Trump administration, which saw Israel sign bilateral agreements on normalisation with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in 2020.In exchange for normalising ties with Israel, Saudi Arabia - which positions itself as a leader in the Middle East and the Islamic world - is asking for major military support from the US, co-operation in establishing its own civilian nuclear programme, and significant Israeli concessions to the Palestinians.The latter would be extremely difficult to achieve under the most religious and nationalist government in Israel's history.""For us, the Palestinian issue is very important. We need to solve that part,"" Crown Prince Mohammed, who is Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, told Fox News correspondent Bret Baier in English.He commented: ""We have a good negotiations strategy till now.""Earlier this month, leaders of the Palestinian Authority held talks with Saudi officials in Riyadh to lay out their demands for a possible deal involving the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel. The BBC learned that these included a cash boost of hundreds of millions of dollars and more control of land in the occupied West Bank.Questioned during his interview about working with Mr Netanyahu's hard-line government, Prince Mohammed said: ""If we have a breakthrough, reaching a deal that gives the Palestinians their needs and [making] the region calm, we've got to work with whoever's there.""Many members of Israel's current governing coalition are firmly opposed to the internationally backed idea of the two-state solution to end the Israel-Palestinian conflict. This would see an independent Palestinian state create alongside Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital in East Jerusalem.Ahead of the prime minister's talks in New York, 11 law-makers within his own right-wing Likud party said in a joint statement that they would block attempts to give land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace with Saudi Arabia.The Wall Street Journal report has raised separate concerns for Israeli politicians.""Normalisation that includes agreeing to turn Saudi Arabia into a nuclear power under the auspices of a ring-wing government is dangerous madness,"" Tali Gottlieb, a Likud member of parliament wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.The US newspaper said that Mr Netanyahu told senior nuclear and security experts in Israel to co-operate with American negotiators on a proposal for a ""US-run uranium enrichment operation"" in Saudi Arabia, quoting unnamed officials. They said that safeguards would be included and that the plan had yet to be signed off by President Biden.Saudi nuclear plans did come up in the Fox News interview with Prince Mohammed.Asked about the possibility of his kingdom's regional rival, Iran, eventually building a nuclear weapon, the Saudi leader said: ""We are concerned of any country getting a nuclear weapon"".He reiterated a point that he has previously made, that if Iran were to obtain a nuclear bomb, Saudi Arabia would ""have to get one, for security reasons, for balancing power.""The prince acknowledged that any country obtaining such a weapon was ""a bad move"", commenting: ""Any country use a nuclear weapon that means they are having a war with the rest of the world.""© 2023 BBC.

BBC,9-Oct,"On the car radio the main news channel was full of the new reality, with freshly recorded stings for the hourly bulletins.""Israel at War"" boomed a bass voice, punctuating reports of continued fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas infiltrators, and air raid alarms close to the border with Lebanon. On the other side of the fence is Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed Lebanese militia that is Israel's most formidable enemy.The prospect that it might enter a two-front war is Israel's strategic nightmare.Outside a military base on the highway that goes south to Gaza hundreds of cars were parked along both hard shoulders and on the central reservation. They were left by reservists who had reported for duty. More were arriving.A man standing next to the open tailgate of his hatchback pulled on a crumpled olive-green army shirt. He fished around inside the back to find his body armour, slammed the door, and went to join the rest of his reserve unit.A middle-aged couple had managed to meet up with their son, a young man of around 20 who is doing his compulsory military service. The mother handed over a jar of home-made pickles.The father said: ""We've told him to concentrate on what he has to do, and not to think too hard about friends who've been hurt and killed.""More armed men have entered Israel through breaches in the wire that was designed by Israel to contain Hamas.Israelis are incredulous that their army is taking so long to regain control of the land and villages bordering Gaza. One unit appealed on social media for drones, others have asked for sleeping bags and food.Israel's military is powerful, well capable of driving Hamas back. But its failure to do so thus far is reinforcing the conviction that the country's lavishly-funded and prestigious military and intelligence establishment should have stopped a catastrophe and did not.Constant comparisons are being made between the events of the last few days and the war exactly 50 years ago, that started in October 1973 after a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria.Golda Meir, the prime minister at the time, ignored warnings that an attack was coming on a Jewish holiday, and was condemned for hubris and complacency.The same accusations are already being thrown at her successor Benjamin Netanyahu, by his many political enemies.Israel is still bitterly divided about Mr Netanyahu, whose government's extreme right-wing agenda prompted months of protests.But citizens of all political persuasion are rallying behind their flag. With Israel officially at war the protests are suspended, and reservists who refused to turn up for duty are now queuing to return.Israelis, collectively, are reeling from the shock of the Hamas attack.As survivors and victims tell their stories, the desire deepens to punish Hamas for the way its men went from house-to-house killing families and children in Israeli border communities. As we drive, callers phoning in to the radio are talking about parents who had calls from their terrified children at the rave in the desert where Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians.They're haunted that parents heard the shots that killed their sons and daughters.""Israel at War"", the sting comes again, with a report from the Israeli minister of defence Yoav Gallant, a former general, speaking somewhere in southern Israel. ""We're fighting animals,"" he says, ""and we'll act accordingly."" Food, water and power supplies to Gaza are being cut.My phone pings. A post on the BBC Jerusalem office WhatsApp group says that a market in Gaza has been hit and many killed as Israel attacked what it said was a Hamas target. The video of broken bodies feels like a harbinger of something even worse.The scale of the bloodshed inflicted on Israel by Hamas is unprecedented. An organisation that planned its attack so carefully will have been aware that Israel's response would be ferocious.Israel's war plans will be complicated by the presence of around 100 hostages taken in the attack. But one cabinet minister, according to a cabinet leak reported in the Israeli press, has said that should not hold them back.This feels very different to the regular confrontations Israel and Hamas have had since the militant group took over Gaza in 2007. They were serious enough.Over the years Israel caused immense damage and inflicted thousands of casualties on Palestinian civilians. But they had fallen into a familiar pattern and felt at times like deadly rituals.Now both sides are in unknown territory.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

""And what fun it is going to be!""Just hours later, their social media pages are now flooded with desperate people trying to find loved ones, after Palestinian militants stormed the festival and opened fire as part of a huge surprise attack on Israel.More than 260 bodies have reportedly been recovered from the festival site, according to rescue agency Zaka.One partygoer, Ortel, said the first sign that something was wrong was when a siren went off at around dawn, warning of rockets. Eyewitnesses said the rockets were quickly followed by gunshots.""They turned off the electricity and suddenly out of nowhere they [militants] come inside with gunfire, opening fire in every direction,"" she told Israel's Channel 12.""Fifty terrorists arrived in vans, dressed in military uniforms,"" she said.""They fired bursts, and we reached a point where everyone stopped their vehicles and started running.

They had intelligence information.""Friends and family members of missing loved ones are now desperately hoping to find them.Among those missing is German tourist, Shani Louk, whose mother believes she was kidnapped. Another woman, 25-year-old Noa Argamani is believed to have been taken hostage at the festival, her family and friends say.Noa's friend, Amit Parpara, told the BBC he was messaging her as she hid.""Around 8:30 was the last message that I got from her,"" he said. Amit later saw a video on social media appearing to show her being taken captive. ""[It shows] her on a motorcycle, being taken away from her boyfriend. You can see clearly her terror going into the Gaza Strip.""The parents of 23-year-old American-Israeli Hersh Golberg-Polin are also looking for their son, who was there after celebrating his birthday. They told the Jerusalem Post they received two short messages from him on Saturday morning reading: ""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry.""At least 700 Israelis have been killed since the attack began, according to the latest figures in local media.Fighting between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants is continuing, and Israel has launched a wave of air strikes on Gaza. The strikes have killed at least 493 people, Palestinian officials say.Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

BBC,8-Oct,"A British man serving with the Israeli military has been killed in an attack by Hamas militants, his family says.Nathanel Young had been serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was killed on the Gaza border on Saturday.The 20-year-old's brother, Eliot Young, said Nathanel had been ""the life of the party"" and was ""loved by everyone"".Two other British citizens - Jake Marlowe and Dan Darlington - are missing in Israel following Saturday's attacks by Palestinian militants.Mr Young's brother Eliot said: ""Nathanel was full of life and the life of the party.""He loved his family and friends and was loved by everyone.""He said Mr Young ""loved music and was a talented DJ"" and ""always had strong Jewish pride"".The soldier was a ""bubbly guy who his four nieces loved playing with"", his brother added.""When Nathanel could have taken his days off to sleep and re-energise, he instead found out where the family was, which wasn't always so close to him, and came to join us,"" his statement continued.In a separate statement on Facebook, Mr Young's family said: ""We're heartbroken to share that our little brother Nathanel Young was tragically killed on the Gaza border yesterday.""Mr Young was a former pupil at JFS, a Jewish school in Kenton, north London, the British newspaper Jewish News reported.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts were with Mr Young's family, as well as ""all those whose families and communities have been touched by this terrible violence"".""Labour stands firmly in support of Israel's right to defend itself, rescue hostages and protect its citizens,"" he said. ""The indiscriminate attacks from Hamas are unjustifiable and have set back the cause of peace.""Sir Keir added that ""we will all stand firm against any intimidation or harassment directed towards Jewish communities here in Britain"".Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had assured Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu of the UK's ""steadfast support as Israel defends itself"".""We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail,"" he added.Mr Sunak said the government was now working to establish the status of UK citizens in Israel, as he knows there will be ""families who are anxious about their loved ones"".Earlier, the Israeli Embassy in London confirmed London-born Mr Marlowe, 26, was missing and it was not known whether he had been taken hostage.Mr Marlowe, who went to the same London school as Mr Young, was working as security staff at an outdoor party near the Gaza border when he disappeared on Saturday.His mother told Jewish News that she had spoken to him as the attacks were taking place.""Then, at about 5.30am, he texted to say, 'signal very bad, everything OK, will keep you updated I promise you,' and that he loves me,"" she said.She told the paper he lived in Ma'alot, in northern Israel, having moved to the country permanently two years ago.The family of Mr Darlington also confirmed he was missing, telling the BBC they had not spoken to him since Saturday morning.The photographer is originally from the UK but lives in Berlin, Germany, and had been visiting friends in Israel.David Darlington, his father, said his son had been travelling with a German woman, and that his half-sister had last spoken to him on Saturday morning.""The communications network is down and we haven't spoken to him for 24 hours,"" he said.Saturday's surprise attack by hundreds of gunmen from Hamas has killed more than 700 people in Israel, according to Israel's Defense Forces.Hundreds of gunmen entered southern Israel, killing soldiers and civilians and taking into Gaza what the army said was a ""significant number"" of hostages.Attendees of the music event near Kibbutz Re'im, where Mr Marlowe was working, have spoken of how gunmen opened fire at revellers in the early hours.One attendee, Gili Yoskovich, told the BBC that she hid under a tree in a field as gunmen roamed around, shooting anybody they found.The UK's Foreign Office said it was ""in contact with - and assisting - the families of several individuals"" in Israel and the Palestinian territories.A spokesperson said they were aware of media reports regarding British nationals but would not discuss individual cases.Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

BBC,8-Oct,"Israeli security forces are carrying out operations to rescue hostages taken by Palestinian militants from Gaza and clear areas they seized on Saturday.The military said troops had secured 22 locations by Sunday morning but were still sweeping through another eight.The surprise attack by hundreds of gunmen from Hamas, under the cover of intense rocket fire, has reportedly killed at least 600 people in Israel.More than 370 people in Gaza have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes.And 400 Palestinian gunmen have been killed and dozens arrested during the fighting in Israel, according to the Israeli military.Saturday saw Israel's deadliest day of violence since the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday night that Israel was going into a ""long and difficult war"". He also warned Hamas, which governs Gaza, that its hideouts would be reduced to ""rubble"".Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said it was on the ""verge of a great victory"".The attack began just after dawn on Saturday, which was the Jewish Sabbath and festival of Simchat Torah.Hamas gunmen cut through the heavily fortified fence that lines Gaza's perimeter and crossed into southern Israel on motorbikes, paragliders and by sea.An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said the militants numbered in the high hundreds, while more than 3,000 rockets were fired towards cities and towns across Israel throughout the day.""They attacked dozens of Israeli communities and IDF bases and went door to door,"" Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said Saturday night. ""They executed Israeli civilians in cold blood in their homes and then continued to drag into Gaza Israeli civilians and military personnel.""Israel's health ministry has not officially confirmed how many people have been killed, but Israeli TV channels reported that the death toll had passed 600 and the same figure was included in a Facebook post from the Government Press Office.This video can not be playedWatch: Israeli forces exchange fire on road near Gaza borderOvernight, Israeli security forces rescued many people who had been held hostage - almost 50 were in the dining area of one small community.At least 10 militants who had taken over the police station in the town of Sderot were killed.Through Sunday morning shootings continued in communities close to Gaza.Near the city of Ashkelon, Israeli forces chased several Palestinian gunmen in a stolen car, killing them in a dramatic shootout on a main road.The IDF earlier told reporters that security forces had secured 22 locations but that there were still eight ""points of engagement"" where troops were going from house to house to confirm that they were ""clean or terrorism"".They included Sderot and the nearby kibbutz (community) of Kfar Aza, where soldiers were said to be fighting to free another group of hostages.Residents who live near the Gaza frontier are also being evacuated.Concerns are also growing for the dozens of Israeli soldiers and civilians, including women and children, who it is believed are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.Relatives of those missing have been asked to hand their belongings to police stations so that DNA samples can be taken.Noa Argamani, 25, and her boyfriend Avinatan Or were among hundreds of people partying at a rave in the fields next to Gaza when the attack began. A video posted on social media showed Ms Argamani screaming in panic as she was taken by militants into Gaza on a motorbike.A friend, Amit Parpara, told the BBC that she sent him several messages as the attack unfolded.""My first contact with Noa was around 06:30, when the [rockets] started,"" he said. ""She sent me her live location, asking for someone to save her and her boyfriend. She was hiding in a hole.""""Around 08:30 was the last message that I got from her,"" he added. ""I tried to tell her to stay low. I tried to contact the police and the military so that they would know their location and might find them.""""About half an hour later, I found that video... You can see clearly her terror.""Mr Netanyahu warned Hamas that Israel held it responsible for the hostages' well-being and would ""settle accounts with anyone who harms one hair on their heads"".He also said the IDF would ""immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities,"" and told Gazans to leave their homes and take shelter.In Gaza, the atmosphere has changed completely from Saturday morning, when many Palestinians were celebrating on the streets. People are now staying indoors, as the territory is rocked by explosions and clouds of black smoke engulf buildings.The IDF said it had struck 426 targets belonging to Hamas by Sunday morning, including a compound belonging to the head of the group's intelligence department.Hamas said 12 houses belonging to senior leaders of the group were hit, as well as branches of its bank.The multi-storey Watan Tower in Gaza City, where internet service providers that served half of the population were based, was also destroyed.Palestinian health ministry officials said more than 300 people, including children, had been killed in Gaza and that another 1,990 had been injured.About 20,000 people have taken shelter in UN schools and hospitals after being told by the IDF to leave their homes immediately, suggesting that they would be attacked by air soon. The Israeli warnings covered Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, and the Daraj area of Gaza City.This video can not be playedMissile strikes next to BBC Gaza rooftop baseDr Khamis Elessi, a neuro-rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant based in Gaza City, told the BBC that the situation was unbearable.""Everywhere you are going in Gaza you see funerals, you see death. You see buildings collapsing. It's like you are watching a movie about the end of life on this Earth,"" he said.""The kids are crying and screaming, there is no electricity, there's no internet and so you feel you could be next.""Israel's security cabinet cut off Gaza's electricity and fuel supplies and the entry of goods in retaliation for the Hamas attack.In a separate development on Sunday, the IDF said its artillery had struck targets in southern Lebanon and carried out a drone strike on ""terrorist infrastructure"" in response to a rocket attack by the militant Hezbollah movement in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area.Hezbollah said it had fired at three Israeli positions ""in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance"", despite a warning from Israel and the US for other parties not to engage and risk a regional war.The Lebanese army said the Israeli retaliatory fire wounded several people, while the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon said it was working with authorities in both countries to avoid a more serious escalation.Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

BBC,8-Oct,"A ""significant number"" of Israeli civilians and soldiers are being held hostage by Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military says.Some are alive and some are presumed dead, military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said.Children, women, the elderly and the disabled were among those taken, he added.""These are numbers that were up until now unimaginable,"" he said. ""This will shape the future of this war.""According to Hamas, the number of Israelis captured was ""several times greater"" than dozens, and they had been taken to locations throughout the Gaza Strip.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was responsible for their wellbeing and Israel would ""settle the score with anyone who harms them"".There are numerous videos circulating online purporting to show Israelis in the hands of Hamas fighters.One video, that has been verified by the BBC, shows a truck being driven through crowds on the Gaza Strip, purportedly carrying Israeli hostages.Another video which has been geo-located to the Gaza Strip, shows a barefooted woman being dragged from the back of a truck with bloodied hands tied behind her back.Some hostages are said to have been taken from an outdoor party in Kibbutz Re'im, a suburb in the city of Ofakim in Israel's south - not far from Gaza.Witnesses told Israeli media that attackers on motorcycles began firing at attendees, many of whom are still missing.Videos posted on social media, which have not been verified by the BBC, appear to show one woman who attended the party being kidnapped and held on a motorcycle by two men.She was identified by her partner's brother Moshe Or as an Israeli woman called Noa Argamani.Mr Or had reported her missing, before seeing her and his brother in the videos, both held by several militants.""I saw Noa in the video scared and frightened, I can't imagine what's going through her mind at all - screaming in panic on a motorcycle,"" he said in an interview with Israeli broadcaster Channel 12.A later video - also not verified by the BBC - appears to show her sipping water in a room in Gaza.This video can not be playedWatch: A day of violence and fearOutside the Gaza Strip, Israeli military forces have reportedly freed Israeli civilians who were being held hostage in two locations in the south.In Kibbutz Be'eri, hostages who were being held in a dining room were rescued after 18 hours, Israel's TV channels reported.Israeli media reports suggested that up to 50 people had been held there.Speaking to Reuters news agency, a woman identified as Ella said she had been barricaded in a bomb shelter for hours in the town.""We can hear a lot of gunfire, we were told that terrorists are in the dining hall, we can hear a lot of shooting,"" she said.""I've lost contact with my family. I know my father has been kidnapped... no one is telling us what's going on. I don't know if my mother is alive.""A video verified by the BBC shows militants in Be'eri leading barefooted people along a street. It is unclear if they were the same hostages as those held in the dining hall.Meanwhile, in Kibbutz Urim, a suburb in the city of Ofakim, two Israelis were rescued after being taken hostage by Hamas militants in a house for hours on Saturday, according to Israel's public broadcaster Kan.Gunmen had entered the city and opened fire on residents as they fled to bomb shelters after rocket alarms were set off in the city, Israeli media reported.The two residents had stayed in their apartment, where four militants then took them hostage. The militants were later killed by Israeli forces.Three Israeli soldiers were injured during the rescue, Kan said.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,12-Sep,"After months of protests against the hardline Israeli government's highly controversial judicial overhaul, an historic showdown is taking place.All 15 Supreme Court judges are convening for the first time to hear petitions against a legal amendment that limits their own powers.Thousands of Israelis gathered for a rally outside the court in Jerusalem on Monday night in support of the judges.Critics argue the move will weaken judicial independence and democracy.""We want to make sure [the judges are] not intimidated by all the threats that this government makes,"" said Yaron, a father-of-two from the coastal city of Netanya. ""This is about democracy.""For Orly, who came from Modiin with her friend, it was more emotional. She felt the fundamental character of Israel was at stake.""Our mother and father were in the Holocaust. We fought for this country,"" she said. ""We cannot let the government do whatever it wants. We don't have anywhere else to go.""In July, the nationalist-religious governing coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed through an important change as part of its radical judicial overhaul.It cancelled the ability of all courts to block government actions and appointments using the legal standard that they were ""unreasonable"".However, supporters of the overhaul argued that the move strengthened democracy by preventing the court from overturning the actions of an elected government.The Supreme Court - which could take weeks or months to deliberate - is under pressure to strike down the law.If it does so, though, members of Mr Netanyahu's government are threatening to ignore its decision. That could lead to a constitutional crisis over who has the greater authority.At a far-right protest last week, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich warned the chief justice not to dare overturn the ""reasonableness"" legislation which affects a basic law in Israel - part of a set of laws that have a key role in the absence of a national constitution.""Invalidating a Basic Law is a deviation from all your authority and will be the end of Israeli democracy,"" Mr Smotrich declared. ""I urge you from here, not to make a decision that will tear the people of Israel apart.""In a grim reminder of the social divisions that have opened up, a young demonstrator in the crowd told the BBC: ""I see that there will be blood in the street. If the left is aggressive, the right will be more aggressive.""Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges which he denies, has been vague when asked whether he would stick to a ruling that would quash the new law.The launch of his coalition's judicial campaign at the start of the year has brought hundreds of thousands of Israelis onto the streets. It has also led to expressions of concern from international allies and dented the economy, amounting to Israel's worst domestic crisis in years.The military has been badly affected with a large number of reservists saying they would not report for voluntary duty. Defence officials warn that Israel's readiness to fight wars could be impaired.""It is probably the most powerful, unimaginable thing we have ever imagined that we need to do,"" said Yiftah Golov, an activist with a reservist group called Brothers in Arms. ""In order to defend my country, I'm signing right now that I won't show up for volunteering.""Other hearings in coming weeks will also put Israel's top judges in the uncomfortable position of ruling on their own fate.A former intelligence division chief for Israel's spy agency Mossad suggests the Netanyahu government is playing with fire, and that it could face a serious pushback.""I believe based on, let us say hunches and hints from inside, that Mossad, [the internal Shin Bet security force] Shabak, police and chief of staff when there is a dilemma, they will say we obey the Supreme Court,"" Haim Tomer explained. ""It's not a Netflix series, it's our life and it's our security.""So far, attempts to reach a compromise deal between Mr Netanyahu and his political opponents have failed. However, the Israeli President Isaac Herzog has continued to try to bring the two sides together.On Monday, the prime minister said he was working to ""exhaust every possibility"" to reach a broad agreement and there were positive remarks from the leader of one opposition party.However, Mr Netanyahu's other political rivals reacted with scepticism and there were tough stands from some in his own coalition with one far-right minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, insisting he would not ""surrender"".© 2023 BBC.

Many Palestinians in Gaza have been killed or injured in the airstrikes.Charities and world leaders have called for children to be kept safe while fighting is ongoing between Palestinian militants and Israel.Although Hamas and Israel have been enemies for many years, this is the largest outbreak of violence in decades.Kids in the UK talk about relatives in Israel and Gaza""We are at war"" says Israeli PM following rocket attacksPM promises extra support for Jewish communities in UKAdvice if you're upset by the newsThis video can not be playedIsrael Gaza: The UK children with family in Israel and GazaIsrael is continuing to carry out air raids in Gaza which it says are designed to impact the militant group Hamas and target its leaders. Israel is expected to launch a ground offensive into northern Gaza soon.Hundreds of thousands of people living in northern Gaza have left their homes following an order from the Israeli military to evacuate the region.The majority of those who have left, are urgently seeking shelter and food - schools and hospitals are overcrowded and food and water is scarce.Some trucks of aid are being allowed into Gaza from Egypt although charities say it isn't enough, but there has been no mention of people being allowed to leave or cross borders into other countries.Hospitals are warning that they are having to close as they don't have enough fuel to keep open.Meanwhile the United Nations (UN) is calling for civilians - people who are not fighting - in both Israel and Gaza to be protected.At a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York on Tuesday 24 October, Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire to end ""epic suffering"" in Gaza and that ""no party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law"".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that every country has the right to defend itself but added that ""humanitarian pauses must be considered"" to protect civilians in Gaza.Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong has called for ""humanitarian pauses on hostilities"" in Gaza to allow for the delivery of aid and the evacuation of civilians.Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry called for a ceasefire, expressing ""regret"" over the Security Council's failure to adopt a resolution calling for one.In recent weeks, world leaders including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have visited Israel after the Hamas attacks on 7 October.Mr Sunak told Mr Netanyahu the UK stands with Israel in support.He said: ""We will stand with you in solidarity, we will stand with your people. And we also want you to win.""Israel is a country in the Middle East, with a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea. It was created in 1948, following World War Two and the Holocaust, as a homeland for Jewish people.Since then, there has often been fighting between Israel, the Palestinians and neighbouring Arab countries, over land, and who it belongs to. Both Jews and Palestinian Arabs claim the land as their ancestral home.Tensions are often high between Israel and Palestinians living in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.This video can not be playedThe BBC's Anna Foster reports on what is happening in IsraelThe origins of the conflict between Israel and Palestinians go back at least 100 years.Britain took control of an area called Palestine after World War One. There was a Jewish minority and Arab majority living there at the time.Over the next few decades many more Jewish people arrived, with many of them fleeing persecution in Europe, and seeking a homeland after the Holocaust in World War Two.In 1947, the United Nations voted for Palestine to be split in two between a Jewish state and an Arab state. Jewish leaders agreed to the plan but the Arab side did not.Britain could not solve the differences and left in 1948. Jewish leaders then declared the creation of Israel.Palestinians objected to this new state, and a war followed. Neighbouring Arab countries invaded Israel.By the time the fighting stopped Israel controlled most of the territory, but Gaza was controlled by Egypt and another area of Palestine, the West Bank, by Jordan. These two areas contained thousands of Palestinians who fled or were forced out of their homes in what was now the new Jewish state.Then, in 1967, after another war, Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank, and Israeli troops stayed there for years. Israelis hoped they might exchange the land they won for Arab countries recognising Israel's right to exist and an end to the fighting.Israel left Gaza in 2005 but soon after, a group called Hamas won elections and took control there. Hamas refuses to recognise Israel as a country and wants Palestinians to be able to return to their old homes - and has repeatedly used violence to try to achieve its aims.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.About 2.3 million people live there and it's ruled by a Palestinian militant group called Hamas, which has fought Israel many times.Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline and restricts who and what goods are allowed in and out. Similarly, Egypt controls who passes in and out through its boundary with Gaza.There is a barrier between Israel and Gaza and along the border with Egypt. Even before this latest fighting it was hard for people to go in and out.Now Israel has cut off the supply of water and electricity, food and medical supplies to the area.Aid agencies say they are worried about the safety of civilians in Gaza as a result of the Israeli restrictions. Israel says that Hamas is responsible for the situation in Gaza, as a result of Hamas' actions in attacking Israel.About 80% of the population of Gaza depends on international aid, according to the UN, and about one million people rely on daily food aid.This video can not be playedBBC Middle East expert Jeremy Bowen talks about the situation in Gaza (2018)BBC Analysis Editor Ros Atkins says that at the moment ""getting out of Gaza is all but impossible"".That's because the crossing between Israel and Gaza is closed and there is a long waiting list for the Rafah crossing into Egypt.People can't leave by boat either because Israel's navy controls the shoreline.The United States says it is discussing with Israel and Egypt about trying to get ""safe passage"" so civilians in Gaza can leave, but no further details have been revealed.Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist militant group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007.The current fighting follows years of tensions between Hamas and Israeli governments.In response to the attacks, Israel's prime minister posted a video statement saying ""we are at war"" and the Israeli military said it has begun bombing targets in the Gaza strip in response ""to the barrages of rockets"".Hamas' military commander Mohammed Deif called on Palestinians everywhere to join the group's operation.On Sunday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israelis they are going into a ""long and difficult war"".UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged ""steadfast support"" to Israel and, talking in Parliament on Monday 16 October, he said the UK must ""support absolutely Israel's right to defend itself"".Speaking to MPs, he described Hamas' attack on Israeli citizens as a pogrom - a word which refers to violent and organised attacks against Jews.He also told MPs that extra government funding has been allocated to protect Jewish institutions in the UK and confirmed the UK was providing a further £10m in humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people.Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf - who has family members in Gaza - says humanitarian supplies need to be allowed in and the crossing to Egypt must be open to allow people to leave. ""There must be a ceasefire,"" he added.US President Joe Biden says his country's support for Israel is ""rock solid and unwavering"". Mr Biden also condemned Hamas' actions as ""evil"" and said the US would boost military aid to Israel.China's leadership has called on both sides to show ""restraint"" and ""cease fire immediately"".Josep Borrell, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said: ""Israel has the right to defend [itself], but it has to be done according to the right of international law, humanitarian law.""Germany's chancellor says ""constant dialogue with everyone"" is needed to stop the conflict growing.
