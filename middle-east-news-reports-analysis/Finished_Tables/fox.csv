However, one source noted that these circumstances can devolve quickly. It was underscored to Fox that if nothing else, the Middle East violence highlights the importance of having an operational House of Representatives and a Speaker.""The Middle East might speed up the election of a Speaker,"" said one House Republican who asked to remain nameless.

This potentially influences the thinking of House Republicans as the vacant Speakership starts to approach a week. Those who may have been willing to slow-roll the selection of a Speaker may quickly get religion.Fox is told if push came to shove, ""(CIA) Director (Bill) Burns and (Director of National Intelligence) Avril (Haines) would probably go ahead and brief (House Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick) McHenry (R-N.C.) because it’s the right thing to do.""CIA and State Department officials briefed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) while he was at the U.S. consulate in Shanghai.

Israeli air attacks on Gaza continue. Flames and smoke rose from the area as a result of the attack on the Gaza. (Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)At the very least, this is a terrible optics problem for Republicans.Democrats are carrying out their duties of governing while Republicans fight among themselves after they bounced their own Speaker from the job.A source noted to Fox that McHenry would certainly receive a briefing if there was a direct threat to the United States or the U.S. needed to be involved militarily.""Say if this went to DEFCON 2,"" said a source.US LAWMAKER EVACUATES ISRAEL AFTER HAMAS LAUNCHES BARRAGE OF ROCKETS IN SURPRISE ATTACK""DEFCON 1"" is the highest ""defense condition"" security posture the U.S. has.However, the House is paralyzed right now without a Speaker. McCarthy, reiterated this problem, during an appearance on Fox Saturday afternoon.""There is nothing the House can do until they elect a Speaker. And I don’t know if that happens quickly,"" said McCarthy.The California Republican knocked down suggestions on Friday that he would resign from Congress. There are now rumblings that perhaps McCarthy could rise from the political ashes like a phoenix and return to the Speaker’s suite.Police officers check suspects at a check point, searching for Hamas militants from Gaza strip on October 8, 2023, in Ashdod, Israel. On Saturday, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched the largest surprise attack from Gaza in a generation, sending thousands of missiles and an unknown number of fighters by land, who shot and kidnapped Israelis in communities near the Gaza border. The attack prompted retaliatory strikes on Gaza and a declaration of war by the Israeli prime minister. (Amir Levy/Getty Images)""Don’t be surprised if you see calls just like that for Kevin to re-emerge,"" said Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Penn.) on Fox before the Middle East crisis.After all, a supermajority of all House Republicans support McCarthy. Many think the junta of eight Republicans who voted to banish McCarthy did so with little cause and were far from justified in doing so. Thus, McCarthy might be the most-electable figure in the House considering global circumstances.But for now, the House cannot function. This would be a far worse scenario if American adversaries like Russia, China, North Korea or Iran were to do something to the U.S. now.But here’s the problem for McHenry. The House created the concept of ""Speaker Pro Tempore"" as part of ""continuity of government"" concerns following 9/11. The House did not anticipate installing a Speaker Pro Tempore over a political dispute which resulted in the removal of the sitting Speaker.DOZENS OF US LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS STRANDED IN WAR-WORN ISRAELScholars argue that McHenry cannot do anything to run the House except gavel in, gavel out and preside over the election of a new Speaker. However, there is some parliamentary evidence that the House did advance a minor resolution in 1814 after House Speaker Henry Clay briefly stepped aside.While the intelligence community may be willing to include McHenry in national security matters now, there is concern among House institutionalists about every action McHenry may take right now.The House operates off a series of precedents: Hinds’, Deschler’s and Cannon’s. These books dictate future maneuvers of the House – predicated on how the House operated in the past. Any action McHenry takes as Speaker Pro Tempore establishes a new precedent, dictating the authority of potential future Speakers Pro Tempores.As it was put to Fox, if McHenry is aggressive in wielding power, that will give the next Speaker Pro Tempore wider latitude. One source said that if McHenry goes too far, that establishes a precedent which may cause some in Congress to ask why they even bother to elect a Speaker and may just start ""appointing a Speaker Pro Tempore by 2055.""Representative Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2023. (Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images)In other words, if McHenry takes an intelligence briefing on the Middle East, future Speakers Pro Tempore may do that. If he tries to advance a bill on the floor, future Speakers Pro Tempore may do that, too.""This is mission creep for a Speaker Pro Tempore,"" said one knowledgeable House parliamentary source. ""A crisis could completely change the role for the future.""But consider this. The House decision to create a ""Speaker Pro Tempore"" after 9/11 was so there was a functioning institution amid a crisis. Surely leaders thought that the Speaker Pro Tempore could take action to respond to critical events. Granted, there isn’t a vacancy in the Speakership because the Speaker was killed in a 9/11-style terrorism attack. But the imprimatur is that the House wanted the body to be functional. And right now, the body is not.So…Fox is told this is why McHenry may be reluctant to take any action on any subject until the House elects a bona fide Speaker. He is handcuffed. But each move by McHenry could widen the authority for the role. Fox is told that’s why McHenry appears to be mindful and judicious in the use of any perceived powers he may have now.""There are guardrails,"" said one source. ""But because this is unprecedented, they don’t have to be followed.""On Friday afternoon, it looked as though it may take days to elect a Speaker. But, as Harold MacMillan postulated, ""events"" sometimes alter the course of governing.House Republicans are scheduled to meet for a closed door House GOP Conference meeting late Monday.On Tuesday, House GOPers will conduct their ""candidate forum"" where those running for the Speakership make their pitches to rank-and-file Members. Then, the Republican Conference will convene again behind closed doors on Wednesday for a ""secret ballot"" to tap their nominee for Speaker. This is NOT the Speaker election. The FULL HOUSE must elect the Speaker. And the number needed to prevail on the floor is much higher than the number needed to win in the conference.On one hand, this is why it could take House Republicans a while to sort out the Speakership. Republicans don’t plan to have a vote on the floor for Speaker until a candidate has the votes lined up.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRepublicans believe it is a terrible look to have repeated, failed, floor vote after floor vote for Speaker, ala January for McCarthy.

Fox News,"  October 17, 2023 2:00am EDT","Joe Biden’s presidency is tracking Jimmy Carter’s four years in the Oval Office so faithfully it must give his campaign team hives. Recent events in Israel create even more parallels. It was a Middle East crisis that brought down Jimmy Carter’s presidency; the current conflict in the region could prove Biden’s undoing as well.In 1979, more than 50 U.S. citizens were taken hostage in Iran, and Carter failed to secure their release. Worse, a U.S. military mission sent to rescue the prisoners failed, infuriating Americans. Carter’s foreign policy blunders sank his reelection bid, but they were far from his only problem. His administration was considered weak and inept, and the events in Tehran reinforced those perceptions.Like Biden, Carter was already in trouble when the hostage crisis occurred. The Georgia peanut farmer presided over sky-high inflation: so has Biden. Carter pushed enormous and controversial increases in government spending: ditto Biden. Like Biden, Carter started with high approval numbers that went pretty much straight downhill.BIDEN ISSUES CRYPTIC WARNING TO IRAN AFTER ADMIN DENIES COUNTRY WAS INVOLVED IN HAMAS ATTACK: 'BE CAREFUL'As he approached reelection in 1980, Carter faced a primary battle from fellow Democrat Senator Ted Kennedy; nearing next year’s presidential election, another Kennedy -- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – was until recently attempting to mount a primary challenge against Biden. History may not repeat but it sure does rhyme.Today, 30 Americans have been murdered by Hamas and more than a dozen are being held captive.  Voters will hold President Biden responsible for punishing the terrorists responsible for those deaths, and for bringing both American hostages and those trapped by war home safely.So far, the Biden White House has not impressed. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan boasted eight days before Hamas’ invasion of Israel that, ""The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,"" displaying either incredible ignorance or unjustifiable smugness.   https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/jake-sullivan-defends-saying-middle-east-region-was-quieter-days-hamas-rcna120490Elsewhere, it turns out that Robert Malley, Biden administration’s ""special envoy"" to Iran, who is known to have had close contacts with Hamas, was put on leave from his State Department post several months ago.  Officially, he has been accused of mishandling classified documents, but there is speculation that he has long worked on behalf not of the U.S. but of Iranian interests.Biden and his national security team have refused to accuse Iran for complicity in Hamas’ attack on Israel, claiming repeatedly there is no evidence of Tehran’s involvement. That is untrue. There is increasing proof that the planning for the attack went on for months, discussed by senior officials of both Hamas and Hezbollah meeting with leaders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Beirut.Biden is understandably loathe to implicate Iran in Hamas’ atrocities. Confronting Tehran could escalate the hostilities in the region, and would also boost oil prices, which would inevitably hurt Biden’s approval ratings. Also, Biden’s White House, foolishly pursuing a nuclear pact, has enriched and emboldened the mullahs, in part by loosening enforcement of sanctions; voters will not look kindly on that decision.Wisconsin Representative Scott Fitzgerald wrote recently in an op-ed, ""Relaxing sanctions has allowed Iran to generate oil revenues exceeding $80 billion annually while strengthening its relationship with China. As I warned in April 2021, using China to dodge U.S. sanctions allows Iran to funnel money to its proxy forces in the Middle East, including the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hamas, which is armed, funded, and led by the Iranian regime.""At the same time, there has been a spike in the number of people on the terror watch list who have been apprehended at the uncontrolled southern border, through which millions of people have entered our country illegally since Biden took office. Fox News reports that four Iranians have been caught since October 1, heightening concerns.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONOur State Department has been slow to help evacuate Americans from Israel, even as other countries have arranged to airlift their citizens to safety. In addition, recent news reports show U.S. citizens responding to our government’s advisory and arriving at the Egyptian border, only to find it blocked and being told to go home.The Biden White House claims to be ""surging additional military assistance"" to our ally. Given that Biden goofed some months ago by admitting that the conflict in Ukraine has drained our stocks of munitions, it is not clear how much we can provide.Hamas, on the other hand, appears to be well-equipped, thanks at least in part to mountains of weapons and ammunition abandoned by U.S. forces in their hasty exit from Afghanistan, which Joe Biden and his team continue to applaud as a ""success.""Meanwhile, while the world has been transfixed by the horrors taking place in Israel and Gaza, the president has carried on with his campaigning. Biden’s support for Israel may be unwavering, but his attention span is not. As Israel declared war, Biden and his wife hosted a barbeque for White House staffers; the next day the president spoke at a Rose Garden campaign event celebrating his efforts to cut down on ""junk fees.""The very next day, Biden traveled to Philadelphia to promote his green energy agenda. An agenda, we note, that includes curbing U.S. oil production and consequently driving prices higher, helping to fund Iran-backed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. The president may have received word that his campaigning was not well received; he abruptly canceled a trip to Colorado on Monday to ""instead hold meetings with his national security team as Israel’s war with Hamas appears set to escalate,"" as one news outlet helpfully explained.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPJimmy Carter, faced with the hostage crisis, had the decency to suspend campaigning and focus his government on the plight of the captive Americans. One of his aides at the time, Stuart Eizenstat, wrote that the Carter’s so-called ""Rose Garden strategy"" ""personalized the crisis in the American media by focusing the responsibility on the Oval Office and showing the terrorists they could put the American presidency itself into dysfunction.""

A statement from the ministry said Hayashi appealed for Iran to act constructively in the matter but did not elaborate.Iranian drones have been a key element of Russia’s continued war on Ukraine. Tehran has offered conflicting accounts about the drones — first denying Iran has supplied them to Russia and later claiming the unmanned aircraft were only sold before the Russian invasion.However, the number of Iranian-made drones used in the conflict shows a steady supply of the bomb-carrying weapons.

""Russia's military presence in any country should not be based on anything temporary.""Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad meet at the Kremlin in Moscow, Wednesday, March 15, 2023. (Vladimir Gerdo, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)JOHN BOLTON WARNS US 'SITTING STILL' AS CHINA, RUSSIA 'SHORE UP THEIR RELATIONS'When Putin intervened in the Syrian civil war in 2015, it helped tip the balance in Assad’s favor, ensuring the survival of the Syrian strongman despite Western demands that he be toppled. Assad has waged a war against his population, resulting in the killing of over 500,000 people, including the murder of Syrians with the use of chemical warfare.The prospective beefed up presence of Russian troops and military bases in Syria would present another challenge to the Biden administration’s Middle East policy. U.S. national security experts see China and Russia outmaneuvering the United States in a region where Washington has historically wielded great influence.Rebekah Koffler, a former analyst at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, told Fox News Digital that Putin started to outmaneuver the U.S. in the Middle East with President Obama, when Biden was his vice president.""Putin tricked Obama and by proxy Biden into letting the Russians transfer chemical weapons out of Syria, back in 2013. Instead, the Russians saw an opening and seized the opportunity to build up its military presence, trying to tip the balance in the Middle East in Russia’s favor. Putin is building an anti-U.S. coalition: Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Syria,"" she noted.Koffler, who authored the book ""Putin’s Playbook,"" added that the Russian leader ""wants the Biden administration to think that he can help with the Iran nuclear deal, a peace settlement in Syria, but in reality, Putin will not do anything that aligns with U.S. strategic interests, especially now that U.S. is backing Ukraine. U.S. and Russia’s security interests are diametrically opposed.""Fox News Digital reported this week that America’s three main adversaries – Russia, China and Iran – plan to hold combined naval military drills in the Gulf of Oman.

(Sana via AP)CHINA DENIES HIDDEN MOTIVES AFTER BROKERING TALKS BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA, IRANA spokesperson for the U.S. State Department told Fox News Digital, ""The evidence on Russia is clear. No matter where they are involved militarily, local civilians pay the price for the Kremlin's destructive playbook that kills civilians to the benefit of Putin. This is clear in Russia’s military campaigns in Syria, Libya and Ukraine, where they use military and paramilitary forces to exploit civilians in conflict zones to advance Moscow’s own selfish interests.""The spokesperson added, ""Russia’s military campaign in Syria in support of the Assad regime has led to massive destruction, as well as the death or displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians. These military operations undermine conditions for a political resolution to the Syrian conflict, and Russia has not exerted any real effort to induce meaningful changes in the Syrian government’s appalling behavior toward its own people. ""The State Department spokesperson stressed that ""Russia’s focus should be on advancing a political resolution in Syria as outlined by U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254, rather than bringing more suffering to the Syrian people."" Resolution 2254, from eight years ago, outlines a peace process to stop the bloodshed in Syria.Michael Rubin, a senior fellow and Mideast expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital, ""Standing by allies matters. Russia stood by its ally without qualms. Not only will Assad reward Putin, but this move sends a signal to every other leader in the region. This isn’t just about Russia’s embrace of Syria. It’s about Russia’s courtship of Egypt and Saudi Arabia.""Rubin added, ""We have to calibrate policy to that reality. The Syrian Kurds are allies and friends. If Turkey is backing Islamists proxies, and Russia is doubling down on Assad, we should double down on the Kurds. They are more progressive, able fighters, and want a pro-Western orientation. The question isn’t only what the United States should do but what it should not do.""Syria is a fragmented country, with territory controlled by Turkey, Syrian Kurds, Russia and Assad.Rubin said, ""This confirms that Syria will not be unified. At best, with Turkey occupying a zone and now Russia doubling down, Syria will be the new 1990s-era Somalia, divided into zones of influence and governed by different local warlords.""Syrian refugees pose for a photograph after their tents flooded from the rain at a temporary refugee camp in the eastern Lebanese town of Al-Faour near the border with Syria. (AP)BLINKEN TRAVELS TO AFRICA AS NEW REPORT SHOWS CHINA, RUSSIA ECLIPSING US ARMS SALES TO CONTINENTRubin warned about the dangers of sending aid to Syria’s regime. ""Any funding we give to international organizations under the guise of reconstruction aid to Syria will essentially reward a Russian proxy for mass murder. Money is fungible. What we give in the name of reconstruction essentially helps Assad and Putin build a base. The fact that Assad offers this shows where his priorities are. Let’s not be naïve,"" he said.Assad delivered to Moscow a series of tangible rewards during his visit. Assad told Putin, ""We believe that if Russia has the desire to expand bases or increase their number, it is a technical or logistical issue.""""Having more bases in Syria is beneficial for Russia and Putin will likely accept the offer,"" Koffler warned. ""Since Russian and U.S.forces operate in proximity in Syria already, expanding Russia’s foothold in the region is giving Putin more leverage and the Russian forces more opportunities to collect intelligence on U.S. war fighting tactics, military hardware, etc. The Russians study U.S. ways of war thoroughly, in order to find vulnerabilities and develop counter-strategies.""Syria stood beside Russia on the issue of Ukraine, Assad said. ""Because this is my first visit since the start of the special military operation in Ukraine, I would like to repeat the Syrian position in support of this special operation,"" Assad told Putin, according to a Kremlin transcript.Syria recognizes the territories of Ukraine that Russia has seized as Russian, Assad said.

Thank you, Joe. Great advice. He should have told them, don't leave the weapons behind, so terrorists can't have them like I did in Afghanistan. The president then said, ""Our Defense Department confirmed that a Hamas rocket hit the hospital, not Israel's."" Yet the president never mentioned radical Islam. He never uttered a single word about fanatical Muslims hell-bent on ethnic cleansing. Never touched it. Skipped right over the root causes. Also, never mentioned Iran.Biden is trying to soft-pedal Iranian involvement because his administration has been letting Iran get away with murder for years. To his credit, President Trump had demolished ISIS, assassinated Soleimani and pulled out of the nuke deal and slapped crippling sanctions on that country's energy sector. He had great relationships with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, all the major Arab players. And Israel was cutting deals with these Arabs and now the deals are on hold because of Iranian mischief.And Biden isn't going to be able to put this back together. He's just not.

For decades the left was wrong about the Soviet Union and China, believing that what the U.S. did or did not do would have a positive influence on communist dictators who jailed and executed opponents of their regime, and still do. Though the Soviet Union is no more, Russia's Vladimir Putin behaves like his predecessors, Mikhail Gorbachev being a possibly milder version.The Biden administration is once again employing the wrong formula in the Middle East. On a recent visit to Saudi Arabia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel would have to make considerable concessions to the Palestinians if a deal brokered by the U.S. with Riyadh were to succeed. Many observers believe that had Donald Trump been re-elected that deal with the Saudis would have been made because Riyadh wants to shore up its defenses against what it considers a threat from Iran. The Abraham Accords seemed a major motivator for Saudi Arabia to join other countries in making peace with Israel.ISRAEL UNVEILS 'MOST ADVANCED' SURVEILLANCE PLANE WITH AI-POWERED SENSORS: 'UNPRECEDENTED'Now that Secretary Blinken has reverted to an old and failed formula, promoted by President Barack Obama and some of his predecessors, the Saudis apparently think they can appease their fellow Arabs by appearing to squeeze Israel into making new concessions. This is despite the fact that previous concessions have not changed the minds of Palestinian leaders who regularly affirm their desire, not just for a state of their own, but for a state that replaces the Jewish state.The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Saudis are considering establishing a nuclear plant provided by China. The U.S. had conditioned its help with nuclear power on the Saudis promising not to enrich their own uranium or mine their uranium deposits.Will we ever learn that you can't bargain with evil, or evil ultimately wins because it knows no constraints?We've seen how such an approach has worked with Iran which appears to be nearing production of nuclear weapons despite numerous U.S. concessions to the religious fundamentalists running the country. No one should be surprised that China's offer of a nuclear plant comes with no conditions.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONNeither should anyone forget what relatives of the nearly 3,000 people who were killed during the 9/11 terrorist attack have been saying - that they believe Saudi Arabia had a major hand in the attack and that there has never been a full accounting of that role.

Brad Cooper also told The Associated Press that he's seen a rise in what he described as Iran's ""malign activities"" in the region over his two years leading the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet.While Cooper pointed to recent seizures of weapons by American and allied forces in the region as a success, he acknowledged that Iran has been able to carry out drone attacks targeting shipping in the Mideast and other assaults in the region.""We’re focused on expanding our partnerships,"" Cooper said on the sidelines of Abu Dhabi's International Defense Exhibition and Conference.

George Wikoff in Bahrain, likely later this year, the 5th Fleet vastly expanded its use of drones and artificial intelligence to patrol those waterways.Cooper said the Navy has reached the halfway mark of his goal to have 100 unmanned drones, both sailing and submersible, operating in the region with America's allies.

Iran carried out that attack, which wounded no one on board, according to a U.S. defense official who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.Iran has denied targeting the vessel, though it has denied other attacks attributed to it since the collapse of the nuclear deal following America's withdrawal from the accord in 2018.""Obviously the nuclear component is all being handled via diplomatic means,"" Cooper said. ""I think over a two-year period, we have for sure seen an increase in the number of malign activities, much of which we’ve been catching just in the last 60 to 90 days.""The United States has, however, interdicted a number of ships carrying weapons bound for Yemen's Houthi rebels from Iran, and France as well as seized one.

""Hamas wouldn't have been able to function at all had it not been for propping up by the Iranian regime.""""But we haven't seen any specific evidence that tells us they were wittingly involved in the planning or involved in the resourcing and the training that went into this very complex set of attacks over the weekend,"" he added.Fox News's Lucas Tomlinson and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a press conference in Tel Aviv, on October 17, 2023, after an overnight meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

That is why the fatwa was issued against Hamas.""According to the council, the decision to issue the legal ruling, which while being non-binding is considered highly influential in the Muslim world, came after the publication of a series of video testimonies from ordinary civilians in Gaza published last month by the U.S.-based Center for Peace Communications.The series, ""Whispered In Gaza,"" which used animation and voice-altering technology to protect the identity of the Gaza-based speakers, offered a rare and unfiltered glimpse into life in the poverty-stricken, embattled Palestinian enclave and highlighted the anger and fears ordinary people there have toward their autocratic Hamas rulers.Hamas, a designated terrorist organization according to the U.S., EU and Israel, has maintained an iron-clad grip on Gaza since violently taking over the territory in 2007 after Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005.

Fox News,"  October 7, 2023 1:09pm EDT","The absence of a House speaker amid the crisis in the Middle East, as Israel works to defend itself from an unprecedented attack by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists, has raised significant concerns among national security circles.The rapidly evolving situation in the Middle East violence highlights the importance of having an operational House of Representatives speaker – and the underscores the challenges of what the interim speaker can do. Specifically, whether Speaker Pro Tempore Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., can or should receive an intelligence briefing about the situation.""The Middle East might speed up the election of a Speaker,"" said one House Republican who asked to remain anonymous. ""This points to why it was a bad idea to kick out [former House Speaker] Kevin McCarthy.""The crisis in the Middle East involving a U.S. ally could recalibrate the thinking of House Republicans as the vacant speakership starts to approach a week.FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS CALL ON HOUSE TO SOLVE 'CHAOS,' WARN 'ENEMIES WILL BE EMBOLDENED'Fox is told if push came to shove, ""(CIA) Director (Bill) Burns and (Director of National Intelligence) Avril (Haines) would probably go ahead and brief McHenry because it’s the right thing to do.""The source noted it would certainly happen if there was a direct threat to the United States or the U.S. needed to be involved militarily.""Say if this went to DEFCON 2,"" said a source.""DEFCON 1"" is the highest ""defense condition"" security posture the U.S. has.A source told Fox News that the Biden administration could take the line that there is no speaker for the House of Representatives. Thus, McHenry would not qualify for an intelligence briefing.However, Fox was also told that President Biden's team sees McHenry as credible and a responsible individual, so even though he is not speaker, the administration may be willing to brief him.So far, there has been no call for an intelligence briefing on the Middle East for the Congressional ""Gang of 8."" That group consists of the House speaker, the House minority leader, the Senate majority leader, the Senate minority leader, and the chairs and top minority members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees.Smoke rises over Gaza City on October 7, 2023 during Israeli air strikes. (MAHMUD HAMS/AFP via Getty Images)That said, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is overseas on a foreign trip to China.Fox is told that a ""Gang of 7"" could convene and leave the top figure in the House out, because there is technically no top figure in the House with the speakership in limbo.Fox has also heard from multiple lawmakers and congressional sources warning of potential problems for the U.S. should there be a need to respond to the Middle East situation or another foreign policy crisis.The House, currently led by McHenry in its absence of a speaker, could not advance any legislative measure related to the crisis should that be necessary.GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DECLARE SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AFTER HAMAS ASSAULT: 'JOE BIDEN FUNDED THESE ATTACKS'Rep. Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 3, 2023. (Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images)But here’s the problem for McHenry. The House created the concept or ""speaker pro Ttempore"" as part of continuity of government concerns after 9/11. The House did not ancitipate installing a Speaker Pro Tempore over a political dispute which resulted in the removal of the sitting Speaker.Scholars argue that McHenry cannot do anything to run the House except gavel in, gavel out and preside over the election of a new Speaker.While the intelligence community may be willing to include McHenry in national security matters now, there is concern among House institutionalists about every action McHenry may take right now.The House operates off a series of precedents, ordered by Deschler’s, Cannon’s and Hinds Precedents. These books dictate how the House has operated in the past. Any action McHenry takes as Speaker Pro Tempore establishes a new precedent, dictating the authority of potential future Speakers Pro Tempores.As it was put it Fox, if McHenry is aggressive in wielding power, that will give the next Speaker Pro Tempore wider latitude. In fact, one source said to Fox that if McHenry goes too far, that establiahes a precedent which may cause some in Congress to ask why they even bother to elect a Speaker and may just start ""appointing a Speaker Pro Tempore by 2055.""In other words, if McHenry takes an intelligence briefing on the Middle East, future Speakers Pro Tempore may do that. If he tries to advance a bill on the floor, future Speakers Pro Tempore may do that.""This is mission creep for a speaker pro tempore,"" said one knowledgeable House parlaimentary source. ""A crisis could completely change the role for the future.""Fox is told this is why McHenry may be reluctant to take any action on any subject until the House elects a bonafide Speaker. He is handcuffed for now. But each move by McHenry. would widen the authority for the role. Fox is told that’s why McHenry appears to be mindful and judicious in the use of any perceived powers he may have now.""There are guardrails,"" said one source. ""But because this is unprecedented, they don’t have to be followed.""North Carolina GOP Rep.

""It's trying to downgrade or devalue the Abraham Accords and counter its expansion.""But the Middle Eastern expert also said that Iran has a long-term goal that it is ultimately working toward – ending U.S. influence in the region.""The Iranian modus operandi has been to divorce some of these GCC countries from their external patron,"" he said in reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council, a trading block made up of the region’s top economic players like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar.

""No, great power competition is a global phenomenon.""But ultimately the Middle Eastern expert warned against overreacting to the deal and pointed out that a panicked response is exactly what China and Iran are hoping for.""They're hoping to have this concern spark something politically, such that the U.S.-Saudi relationship – which is a little bit on the rocks – ends up becoming a U.S.-Saudi divorce,"" he said.

However, he argued the context was ""completely different.""""A powerful state, with powerful allies and a powerful army, engaged in a retaliatory attack against stateless Palestinians under Israeli-settler colonial rule, military occupation and siege, is thus portrayed as powerless Jews in a struggle against Nazis,"" the professor complained.While both sides should be held accountable for their ""war crimes,"" world leaders were ""distort[ing]"" reality by not putting the conflict in the context of Israel's ""settler colonial violence against Palestinians since the 1948 Nakba,"" he argued.The ""Nakba,"" meaning ""catastrophe,"" is a term that Palestinians use to describe the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel.""No justice is possible, not in the short term and certainly not in the long term, without a truthful reckoning of how we got here,"" Segal wrote.He also suggested Israel was demonizing Palestinians in the same way that Nazis did to Jews, to justify their ""genocide.""""The fantasy of 'fighting Nazis' drives such explicit language, because the image of Nazis is one of ‘pure, unadulterated evil’, which removes all laws and restrictions in the fight against it.

""He must resign.""""The Secretary-General, once again, distorts and twists reality. He clearly said yesterday that the massacre by Hamas ‘did not happen in a vacuum.’ Every person understands very well that the meaning of his words is that Israel has guilt for the actions of Hamas or, at the very least, it shows his understanding for the ‘background’ leading up to the massacre,"" he continued.""A Secretary-General who does not understand that the murder of innocents can never be understood by any ‘background’ cannot be Secretary-General.

It was barbaric, it was outside the circle of civilized human behavior, and if it happened to your family, you would want justice.""""I’m not talking about revenge,"" Pelosi added. ""I’m saying justice.""Pelosi rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war. ""So there has to be some other place we go instead of just saying ‘let’s have a ceasefire,’"" she said.

Israel’s ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza has put new pressure on Republican candidates to directly address the conflict and emphasize traditional Republican support for Israel, according to The Associated Press, which interviewed more than a dozen Iowa conservative activists.Since the Oct. 7 attack, Iowa’s evangelical pastors, faith leaders and rank-and-file caucus participants have been looking more closely at candidates’ statements, while ministers urge their congregations to keep those positions top-of-mind when weighing their options.Several 
leading Republican candidates, including former President Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott, have told Iowans where they stand on the conflict and shared how they would respond if they were in the White House.In Iowa, just three days after Hamas attacked Israel and killed more than 1,400 people — which were mostly civilians — several Christian pastors delivered a message meant to resonate both biblically and politically.""What we’re seeing in that region is pure evil,"" said Steve Rowland, a senior minister at the Rising Sun Church of Christ in the Des Moines suburb of Altoona. ""Israel has mobilized their army, and they are intent on stamping out evil, and we should be behind them.

And in doing so, I also clearly stated, and I quote, 'But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas,'"" Guterres continued.""And then I went on with my intervention, referring all my positions on all aspects of the Middle East crisis.

""I think he knew what his end was going to be, and he did it anyway.""Mesika and his friends were resting in the tents at the end of the party when they heard rocket sirens. Hamas sent out missiles from the Gaza Strip as a cover for their ground invasion. The group of friends quickly packed, got into the car and drove to a small bomb shelter for safety. While in the car, Lotan said Mesika was texting his younger brother about what was happening. At the time, they didn’t know that Hamas terrorists infiltrated parts of the country.When Mesika and his friends heard machine guns and Arabic language – it dawned on them that there were terrorists looking to hunt and kill. They saw the terrorists approaching other shelters and throwing grenades into them. When they heard terrorists approaching their shelter, Mesika and his best friend Eli instructed the girls to hide, left the shelter and charged at the terrorists to attract attention.The boys were killed by gunfire in a heroic act to save the women, who remained in the shelter for six hours until the Israel Defense Forces rescued them.Mesika, Eli and another friend named Matan – who were childhood buddies – were buried side-by-side together in Israel.""There's some… vortex that we're in at the moment,"" Lotan said.

He also suggested the establishment of an international peace conference for Israel and the Palestinians.“All sides must pull their fingers off the trigger, a cease-fire must be declared,” he said.The Associated Press contributed to this update.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokeswoman denounced UN Secretary-General António Guterres for saying Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack that killed an estimated 1,400 people ""did not happen in a vacuum.""Guterres addressed the UN Security Council describing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the need for a two-state solution.""It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.

Part of why it differs from the Holocaust is because Jews have today a state and an army. We are not defenseless and at the mercy of others.""However, it puts to test the sincerity of world leaders, intellectuals and influencers that come to Yad Vashem and pledge “Never Again”.  Those who seek to ""understand"", look for a justifying context, do not categorically condemn the perpetrators, and do not call for the unconditional and immediate release of the abducted – fail the test.

He was also related to senior Hamas operatives, including Mohammed Deif, supreme commander of Hamas' military wing.The IDF said Mubasher was responsible for ""numerous terror attacks"" against Israelis and IDF soldiers over the years, including the 2002 attack at the Atzmona pre-military academy, which left five students dead and several more injured.He is also accused of directing the 2003 terror attack in the Vered Post, being involved in the infiltration into Zikim beaches during Operation ""Protective Edge,"" and manufacturing explosive devices used to explode a tunnel under an IDF post in Gush Katif in 2004, which claimed the life of an IDF soldier and injured several others.Since Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli forces say they have killed at least 21 of the terrorist group's leaders.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported early Wednesday morning that Hamas terrorists attempted to invade Israel by sea on Tuesday.""Hamas terrorists attempting to infiltrate Israeli territory by sea were identified by naval forces in southern Israel earlier today,"" the IDF explained in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

Today, the Palestinian youth and the anti-oppression, anti-occupation movement in Palestine is more energetic, more alive, and more prepared than ever during the past 70 or 80 years. God willing, the movement will achieve its goals.""The ""usurper regime"" is Israel for Khamenei, whose jingoistic foreign policy consists of the destruction of the Jewish state and the financing of Palestinians terrorist groups  on Israel’s borders.Lior Haiat, the spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, told Fox News Digital on Saturday, ""Those terror organizations [Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad] are working as proxies of the Ayatollah regime "" in the Islamic Republic.AT LEAST 100 DEAD AS HAMAS LAUNCHES UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON ISRAEL, NETANYAHU SAYS NATION IS 'AT WAR'Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Republic of Iran, partners with the Palestenian Hamas terrorist group, are driving the war that was launched against Israel, according to Foreign Ministry and Middle East experts. (Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA/Reuters )Haiat added: ""Iran is trying for years, especially in the last few months, to have a terror organization, both the Islamic Jihad that is fully supported and financed by Iran, and Hamas terror organization that is also financed but not fully by Iran. They are calling them to attack Israel and Israelis.""He stressed that Iran is ""without a doubt . . . behind the scenes"" of this war against Israel.The Iranian regime-controlled Tehran Times reported on Saturday that the Islamic Republic backs the Palestinian Hamas and PIJ war against Israel. According to the Tehran Times article, Iran’s Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi declared the war on Israel as  ""glorious"" that has murdered at least 100 Israelis.""We declare our support for this operation, and we are confident that the Resistance Front also supports this move,"" Safavi told attendees at the 6th International Conference of Solidarity with Palestinian Youth. He added that Iran will stand alongside the Palestinian resistance ""until the liberation of Palestine and al-Quds.""Iran’s reference to Palestine means the Jewish state, and al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem, the capital of Israel.The Iran-backed Hamas invasion of Israel follows President Biden’s decision just last month to release $6 billion dollars to Iran as part of a prisoner swap.While the Biden administration said the funds will be supervised by Qatar and not used for terrorism, Iran’s U.S.-sanctioned President Ebrahim Raisi boasted that the money will be used ""wherever we need it.""Yigal Carmon, the founder and president of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), predicted the outbreak of the Iran-backed war in a late August article titled ""Signs Of Possible War In September-October.""Carmon, a former counter-terrorism adviser to two Israeli Prime Ministers, wrote, ""There has also been an increase in efforts by Iran and Hezbollah to smuggle weapons into the West Bank, similar to the smuggling of weapons into Gaza.""ISRAELI PM NETANYAHU DECLARES 'WAR AFTER HAMAS TERRORISTS LAUNCH MASSIVE ATTACK: LIVE UPDATESRockets into Israel from Gaza Strip (Photos Majdi Fathi/TPS)Hezbollah is a U.S.-designated Lebanese terrorist movement responsible for the mass murder of hundreds of Americans.Carmon wrote, ""There have recently been increasing reports about the potential use of new weapons by Hezbollah, Hamas and the PIJ that can cause a large number of Israeli fatalities, such as extra-powerful explosive charges and rockets fired on Israeli localities, as mentioned above. In this situation, Israel will likely be compelled to undertake a large-scale response, above and beyond its routine counter-terrorism measures, even at the cost of an all-out war.""Carmon continued that the Iranian-regime controlled PIJ ""secretary-general Ziad Al-Nakhaleh said that, during his June 2023 meeting with Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei, the latter had ‘reiterated [the need to] develop the arming of the West Bank and the resistance there.""Nakhaleh added: ""We, as Palestinians and as resistance forces and movements, understand the importance of arming the West Bank, but this requires efforts by the Palestinians themselves, and also the assistance of our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran.""All of this helps to explain Iran’s laser-like focus on creating multiple war fronts against the tiny Jewish state.OUTRAGE AS IRAN PRESIDENT PREPARES TO ADDRESS UN: 'WANTS TO KILL AMERICAN CITIZENS'The militant Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented, multi-front attack on Israel at daybreak Saturday, firing thousands of rockets as dozens of Hamas fighters infiltrated the heavily fortified border in several locations by air, land and sea and catching the country off guard on a major holiday.

Hamas is an Iranian proxy that dominates the Gaza Strip and is acting in accordance to its instructions, in particular since Hamas' number two Saleh Aruri became a much more dominant figure in the organization.""Avivi added: ""Iran sees Saudi Arabia and other pragmatic Sunni countries begin to normalize relations with Israel and seeks to strengthen the Iranian-Hamas-Hezbollah axis around the Middle East. Hezbollah made a statement calling Arab countries to stop normalization efforts. That is why we have to unite behind the Israeli-American-pragmatic Sunni bloc and defeat terrorism wherever it acts.

We are not all right when right here in the City of New York you have those who celebrate at the same time when the devastation is taking place in our city,"" he continued.""We are not all right when Hamas believes that they are fighting on behalf of something and their destructive, despicable action that carried out.

""We write today to make clear that our states absolutely condemn these heinous acts of terrorism led by Iran-backed Hamas and proudly stand with Israel and the Jewish people.""""Your administration’s initial response—including a call for a ceasefire—created dangerous confusion that has only further emboldened state-sponsors of terror and their henchmen to continue attacking Israel,"" the letter continued. ""Unfortunately, this type of international chaos and violence is a direct result of your administration’s appeasement-first foreign policy. Now is the moment to radically change course.""The letter added, ""We call on you to project American strength by, among other things, clearly and unequivocally condemning these attacks and supporting Israel’s unquestioned right to respond and defend itself. When the lives of American citizens hang in the balance, the American President must speak boldly and act decisively.""The governors list of requests includes prioritizing the protection of Americans who remain in harm's way in Israel, providing ""unequivocal support"" to Israel as it defends itself from Hamas' attacks, easing Biden's ""appeasement and empowerment"" of Iran including freezing the $6 billion payment made to the country in a prison exchange and closing the U.S.-Mexico border to ""protect Americans from similar threats at home.""More than 2,800 people have been killed in the war since Hamas launched its largest attack on Israel in decades last week, leading to retaliatory action from Israeli forces.

 had an unclassified briefing with members of Congress this week about potentially adding aid to Israel in a package with Ukraine, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.A source told Fox News Digital senior officials in the administration briefed the upper chamber on a phone call that it would like to see a ""mega package"" of aid to both nations, as well for Taiwan, border security and a nonprofit security program to protect houses of worship like synagogues, mosques and churches.But the Senate is out on recess until next week, and the House is frozen without a leader after it voted to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., last week. Negotiations in the upper chamber are more likely to go public next week since the temporary spending patch for the government expires Nov. 17. The current spending deal does not include any additional assistance to Ukraine.While talks behind closed doors began this week, the Biden administration has not publicly asked Congress for a funding package for Israel, which would mainly replenish its weaponry and strengthen its Iron Dome defense. The administration did not put a figure on the supplemental package the White House is seeking.One source familiar with the talks said congressional members ""brought up what Israel might need"" and ""asked the (administration) their plans."" The administration outlined three areas for Israeli military support: precision-guided munitions, artillery and air defense, also known as the Iron Dome.According to another GOP aide, there is more bipartisan support for aid to Israel in both chambers compared to those who are supportive of sending more aid to the Eastern European nation. Ukraine has already received upward of $100 billion from the federal government to aid in its defense against the Russian invasion that began in February 2022.The difference between the two regions, one GOP aide said, is that Ukraine needs much more support on a ""ground zero"" scale, whereas Israel is already an established nation that will likely need a much smaller funding amount to support its fight against Hamas.Fox News' Jamie Joseph contributed to this updatePresident Joe Biden speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House, Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, in Washington, after the militant Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented, multi-front attack on Israel at daybreak Saturday.

United Nations Security Council still does not recognize or sanction Hamas as a terror group -- despite multiple other nations declaring it to be so.""The U.N. Security Council votes to impose sanctions and designations on groups like al Qaeda, the Taliban or ISIS. But no such sanctions or designations exist for Iran’s axis of terror groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah,"" Richard Goldberg, senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.The Council, under resolutions passed in 1999, 2011 and 2015, sanctions ISIS and al Qaeda, along with associated individuals and groups. The Council’s committee on those resolutions oversees sanctions measured imposed by the council.However, there are no such sanctions in place for Hamas and Hezbollah. The lack of sanctioning comes as Israel is pushing back against Hamas after it was hit by a surprise attack that killed more than 1,300 Israelis.""The U.N. insists these are legitimate political movements and therefore can freely work with them,"" said Goldberg, who previously served as the director for countering weapons of destruction at the White House National Security Council between 2019 and 2020.Israeli and U.S. officials

However, when asked about Hamas' attacks in Israel on Saturday, they responded, ""it's great that they're making a move against the IDF.""""There's been a lot of accusations of various atrocities, which I take with a grain of salt,"" Alex continued. ""Only one side has the power to stop the violence, and it's Israel.""Pro-Israel college students at the University of Massachusetts were disgusted at the rhetoric used at a pro-Palestinian demonstration on campus celebrating the ""historic win"" of Hamas' deadly attack on Israel.""I was overwhelmed by how many people came out to support what I think is just terrible,"" Olive, a Jewish college student, said. ""It’s a massacre of innocent civilians, and it should be strongly condemned, and instead they’re here celebrating this.""Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and vigils have taken place in several major U.S. cities following Hamas' deadly surprise attack on Saturday that's led to at least 1,200 Israelis killed and many others taken as hostages, including soldiers, women, children and older civilians. The Israeli government declared war against Hamas and begun an assault on Gaza in response, killing at least 1,400 in the territory, according to Palestinian authorities.Many college campuses have held demonstrations for the Israel-Hamas war, including hundreds who gathered for a protest led by UMass Amherst students to support justice in Palestine on Thursday. The flyer posted on social media for the event told students to meet outside the college’s student union to stand in solidarity with Palestinians ""breaking out of their open air prison.""""It was a very peaceful protest,"" Hakan, a pro-Palestinian supporter, told Fox News Digital during the event. ""Palestine will be free.""""A lot of people came to support,"" he continued. ""Some people came to try and make a scene.""A small group of pro-Israeli protesters showed up to the event. Some students told Fox News Digital the demonstration was ""disgusting"" and ""upsetting.""""They are supporting a terrorist organization,"" Milana said.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed Thursday that 27 Americans have been killed in the ensuing war between Israel and Hamas.A Hamas spokesman threatened Monday that the group would kill one hostage for every unannounced Israeli airstrike that hit civilian homes in Gaza. Hamas is known to hide in tunnels under civilian structures, using the people of Gaza as human shields against Israel's wrath.Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin landed in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday at around 9:41 a.m. local time to meet in person with Israeli leaders following the terrorist attacks launched on the country by Hamas on Saturday.Austin is expected to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant and the Israeli War Cabinet during the visit aimed at showing America's ""unwavering support"" for the Israeli people and ensuring Israel ""has what it needs to defend itself,"" according to a DoD news release.He is also expected to view some of the security assistance delivered to Israel from the U.S.Friday's visit marks Austin's second trip to Israel this year and his third since becoming Secretary of Defense.Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also in the region and is scheduled to meet separately with Jordanian King Abdullah II and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman, Jordan, Friday morning.Harvard president Claudine Gay released a video titled ""Our Choices""

 the 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza to evacuate the area within 24 hours as a ""humanitarian step to minimize civilian casualties"" ahead of the military's response to Hamas' terrorist attacks.Israel Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus shared the message sent to citizens in Gaza on X, formerly Twitter, Friday morning.""The IDF calls for the evacuation of all civilians from Gaza City from their homes southwards for their own safety and protection and to move to the area south of the Wadi Gaza, the river Gaza, as shown on the map,"" Conricus said.He explained that telling people to move south of the river makes the directions clear and understandable for everybody, regardless of if they have a map or not.Conricus said the evacuation order is for safety purposes, adding that civilians will not be able to return to Gaza City until another announcement clearing the area is made. He also said to not approach the area of the security fence with Israel.Hamas operates out of Gaza City in tunnels underneath homes and inside buildings populated with innocent civilians in efforts to use them as human shields.The IDF said it will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City and make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians.Roni Esehel, 19, has been missing since the Oct. 7, when Hamas terrorist fighters attacker the army base where she was serving, her uncle Elad Levy said.The uncle of a 19-year-olf Israeli teenage girl who was serving in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said she has gone missing after Hamas terrorist fighters attacked her army base.In a Fox News op-ed, Elad Levy described his niece, Roni Esehel, as a “loving child” who enlisted in the IDF a year ago and was based at an army camp on the Israel border with the Gaza Strip.“On Saturday morning, her world and all of our worlds changed,” Levy wrote. “Hundreds of blood-thirsty Hamas terrorists infiltrated the base. At around 9:30 a.m. Roni sent a text message to her mother, ‘Mom, I am okay, I am busy, I love you.’ And since then, not a word.”Now Roni’s parents are living a nightmare, he said.He called the surprise attack on Saturday against Israeli civilians by Hamas was “genocide. Nothing less.”“The Hamas terrorist organization
 has one purpose only,” Levy said. “To kill Jews, wherever, whenever, whoever. One-year olds and ninety year-olds. Females. Families. Hamas is no different than ISIS or Al Qaeda. And all sponsored and directed by Iran.”Now “is the time to stand with Israel against the axis of evil,” he said. “This is the time to firmly safeguard the values and morals that light our shared path, unconditionally and unequivocally!”President Biden has declared that he stands with Israel against the Hamas terrorists, but his actions in the White House have facilitated these homicidal attacks by financing our enemies through bad energy policies, Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, wrote in an op-ed.Biden’s war on American energy started on day one, Moore said, citing the president’s action to kill the Keystone XL pipeline and the systematic reversal of Donald Trump’s pro-America energy policies.The Institute for Energy Research lists scores of Biden anti-fossil fuel policies that include in just recent weeks taking millions of acres of prime oil and gas lands – from Alaska down to the Gulf of Mexico – out of production.Biden’s environmental rules and higher taxes
 on the industry seem intentionally designed to bankrupt this industry – much as he promised he would do if elected president, Moore said.Aside from hurting the U.S. economically, high energy prices also have national security implications as well.“We have known for fifty years that terrorist organizations like Hamas are primarily financed with petro-dollars,” Moore wrote. “We also know from the days of the OPEC oil embargoes of the 1970s that the nation that has control of oil markets has a commanding height of geo-political influence around the world. It is a truism that in 21st century global confrontations, economic might is foremost in fending off enemies.”A team of military veterans is helping Americans get out of Israel as the country battles Hamas terrorists and the war between the two escalates.Project Dynamo CEO Bryan Stern appeared Wednesday on FOX Business Network’s ""Cavuto: Coast to Coast,"" saying that plenty of Americans are stuck in territories in Israel.""Right now, it’s like the calm before the storm,"" Stern told host Neil Cavuto. ""But there’s hundreds of Americans that are here that are trying to get out. And the carriers are dropping one at a time like flies, so very soon it’s going to be charter air or the government.""Project Dynamo has deployed to several war zones in recent years when the U.S. government has struggled to evacuate American citizens stuck in the chaos.The company began with pulling Americans out of Afghanistan before rescuing Americans in Ukraine and Sudan, Stern said.""So that’s four war zones in the span of 24 months, 25 months, where this pattern is. Why that is, is above my pay grade, but what I will say is that if you’re an American family and you’re stuck in Israel and you’re under air raid alert you’re looking for help and the help’s just not here,"" Stern said. ""That’s the reality of it. That’s not a political thing, that’s not an opinion, that’s just a fact of life.”White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that the U.S. will start arranging charter flights for Americans to leave Israel beginning on Friday with flights going to sites in Europe.""They're still working through some of the details of that, to assist U.S. citizens and their immediate family members who have, for whatever reason, not been able to provide commercial transit out of the country,"" Kirby said.""And I would add that we're also exploring other options to expand the capacity of doing this, including exploring whether it's possible to help Americans leave by land and by sea,"" he added.A volunteer with an Israel-based  search and rescue unit said the acts committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians go far beyond the depictions of a ""regular war.""Tomer Peretz is an American artist who was visiting Israel with his two sons when hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel and shot rockets into civilian villages.He joined ZAKA, which specializes in locating and clearing dead bodies, saying he wanted to do whatever he can to help.""I never thought in my worst nightmare that anyone could do stuff like that. You see body parts all over. Babies. Kids,"" Peretz told followers in a video on his Instagram. ""What kind of animal does stuff like that?""In one day, a crew of around 50 members picked up over 100 bodies in a small farming community, according to Peretz.

Since then, Israel has declared war on the terror group and has continued to target Hamas positions.During his remarks, Netanyahu also criticized calls by some for Israel to engage in peace talks with Hamas despite the group having targeted Israeli civilians, even children and the elderly.“Hamas is ISIS and the world that was outraged by ISIS and Al-Qaida after 9/11, formed an international coalition to eliminate this blight,” he said. “Nobody said 'Let's meet with the representatives of ISIS or Al-Qaida.’ Nobody said 'Let's give them an office in our country.'”“Therefore, I said today – there is no such office and if there are countries that maintain their presence, get rid of them, vomit them out of the countries of the world,” he added. “Vomit them out.

""We understand that the hardening on both sides is very large, but no matter what the level of hardness on both sides, it is still necessary to strive to minimize or reduce to zero, to minimize losses among the civilian population: women, children, the elderly.

This applies to both sides.""""I would add that the position of Russia, which you mentioned, and I have just outlined it, has not developed today, not in connection with these tragic events, it has been formed for decades, and this position is well known to both the Israeli side and our friends in Palestine. We have always advocated the implementation of the decisions of the UN Security Council, referring primarily to the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state.

Since Saturday, more than 2,400 people have been killed including around 1,200 Israelis and at least 22 Americans.""We know that Hamas doesn't like Israel. We know they don't like us,"" Dratwa said. ""But we didn't know, and we have been extremely surprised by the animosity of the terrorists, by the hatred that was so deep and so badly that I don't think that in Western civilization we are able to understand how much indoctrination happened in Gaza.""He continued, ""And we're told that they want to build a country, maybe. But now we get a strong message that Hamas doesn't want to build anything. They only want to destroy, and they want to destroy the only Jewish state.""However, since the attack, Israel has faced backlash of its own, ranging from calls for a ""ceasefire"" by members of Congress to suggestions that the country alone was responsible for the violence. Pro-Palestinian protests also took place across multiple cities throughout the United States, attacking the ""apartheid"" state of Israel.Dratwa pushed back against these and other criticisms for failing to understand the situation Israelis face.""So I think this is really my response to the ‘ceasefire.’ You cannot expect Israel to behave differently than other countries in the world. These are double standards, and we are not going to behave differently than how United States, France, Canada, Germany and other countries [would] have reacted to such attack. We're going to react with all our means and everything that every other country would have done across the world, because this is the right thing to do,"" he said.He added, ""This is my response to those calling Israel an apartheid state. I would like to see them being Jewish Israelis for one day and then to understand the situation.

What’s missing, though, is … well, what was missing,"" Carafano wrote Wednesday.

Tehran’s payback to the U.S. and Biden was not only to cheerlead as Hamas terrorists decapitated babies, but to likely assist in supporting and planning the terror campaign,"" he wrote.""The president could not even bring himself to mention Iran in his speech on Tuesday. That’s a clear signal the administration is clueless what to do now that it’s been hit with irrefutable evidence that its Iran policy has utterly and completely failed.""The White House has refused to answer questions on the future of U.S.-Iran relations in light of the war between Israel and the Iran-backed terrorist group Hamas.Fox News Digital reached out to the White House at least three times this week inquiring if the U.S. would participate in negations and return to the nuclear deal if evidence is found that Iran helped plan the brutal attacks against Israel. The White House's press office ultimately referred Fox News Digital to the National Security Council Monday, which did not respond to the inquiry.News broke Sunday that Iranian security officials allegedly approved Hamas' plan to attack Israel during a meeting in Beirut last Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported. Hamas and Hezbollah leaders said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps worked with Hamas since August on air, land and sea attack plans.Following the report, U.S. leaders said they have not found direct evidence of Iran planning the attacks in coordination with Hamas but noted that Iran has long supported Hamas, and the nation holds ""a degree of complicity"" in the attacks.""We are looking through the information streams. We haven’t seen hard, tangible evidence that Iran was directly involved in participating in or resourcing and planning these sets of complex attacks that Hamas pulled off over the weekend,"" Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the National Security Council John Kirby said Tuesday, something echoed later on in the day by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who again stressed that the U.S. has no evidence that Iran knew about the attacks in advance or that it helped Hamas.Both Sullivan and Kirby's comments this week echo what a U.S. official told Fox News Digital on Sunday evening, that ""of course"" Iran is in the picture, but that U.S. officials currently do not have information corroborating the report.When asked specifically about the future of the U.S. relationship with Iran, however, the White House has not said if leaders would return to the negotiating table for the Iran nuclear deal or if the U.S. strategy with Iran will change in light of terrorist leaders claiming Iran helped with the attacks.Fox News' Emma Colton contributed to this update.Stephanie Hallett, the Chargé d’Affaires ad interim at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, became emotional while describing the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists in Israel.Hallett, in a video posted on X, choked up as she stood amid the rubble in an Israeli town near the border with Gaza.""We've come down here along the Gaza periphery to bear witness to the atrocities that were committed here on Saturday,"" Hallett said.""It's really unbelievable,"" she continued, forcing back tears.

Ein HaHoresh was founded in 1931 and is still a working kibbutz today. It is located north of the Israeli city of Netanya.Kibbutz, “communal settlement” in Hebrew, is a collective community based on socioeconomic values that joins together based on shared ownership of property, production and education.The concept of kibbutzim dates back to the early 20th century. Young Jewish immigrants founded the first kibbutz to establish a new way of life based on socialist and agricultural principles. Kibbutz Degania and subsequent communities were founded on concepts of equality, cooperative labor and self-sufficiency.According to the Virtual Jewish Diary, about 130,000 people live in kibbutzim, roughly 2.5 percent of the entire national population. Many of these kibbutzim are affiliated with one of three major national kibbutz movements, each closely associated with a distinct set of principles and beliefs.Within the kibbutz, a system of direct democracy prevails. The membership convenes in a general assembly to shape policies, select leaders, sanction the kibbutz's financial plan and admit new members. This assembly serves as a governing body and a platform for members to voice their thoughts and perspectives.The influence of the kibbutz on Israeli society
 has been remarkably significant, leaving a mark on the nation's foundation and the formative years of notable politicians, military leaders, artists and authors.Fox News’ Maeghan Dolph contributed to this report.Soldiers walk past tanks moving outside of Kibbutz Kfar Aza where days earlier Hamas militants attacked this kibbutz near the border with Gaza, on October 10, 2023 in Kfar Aza, Israel.

The Eisenhower carrier strike group will be leaving later this week from Norfolk, Virginia.On Sunday, the Pentagon
 said the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group would be leaving for the Eastern Mediterranean, which would place it within range to provide a host of air support or long-range strike options for Israel if requested.The Associated Press reported the Ford carrier strike group arrived Tuesday.The Pentagon has said that the U.S. warplanes, destroyers and cruisers that sailed with the Ford will conduct maritime and air operations which could range from intelligence collection and interdictions to long range strike.Along with the Ford, the U.S. is sending the cruiser USS Normandy and destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney, and USS Roosevelt, and augmenting regional Air Force F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter aircraft squadrons in the region.""USCENTCOM stands firmly with our Israeli and regional partners to address the risks of any party seeking to expand the conflict,"" said General Michael ""Erik"" Kurilla, Commander, U.S. Central Command.Fox News' Liz Friden and the Associated Press contributed to this update.Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy speaks during the second Republican presidential primary debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, on September 27, 2023.

Nikki Haley and others who have not offered ""a pragmatic path forward.""""The Hamas-led attacks on Israel
 were barbaric and cannot be condoned. We require a rational response that supports Israel while avoiding another U.S.-led disaster in the Middle East,"" Ramaswamy said in a statement first shared with Fox News Digital. ""I am disappointed and deeply concerned by the remarks of certain presidential candidates including Nikki Haley who have irresponsibly called the Hamas attack an ‘attack on America’ and rabidly shout ‘FINISH THEM!!’ repeatedly without offering a pragmatic path forward.""""The U.S. should provide Israel with diplomatic support, intelligence-sharing, and necessary munitions to defend its own homeland, while taking special care to avoid a broader regional war in the Middle East that would *not* advance U.S. interests,"" he added.The Ramaswamy plan, according to his campaign, would:1) Offer Israel robust intelligence support and stand ready to provide additional military supplies via both sale and transfer.2) Immediately confirm an American ambassador to Israel, with the vacant embassies in Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Oman to be filled in quick succession.3) End all further nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, including the full phase-out of Iran’s nuclear program and immediately ending Biden’s disastrous plan to share nuclear technology with Saudi Arabia.4) Fast-track the deportation of any resident aliens who have served with Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, including extradition to Israeli custody where appropriate.5) Work with Israel to identify countries willing to accept peaceful Palestinians who wish to escape the pressures of Hamas and facilitate their emigration.6) Warn the UN of consequences if its historical pattern of drawing false equivalences between Israel and the terrorists who target it.Fox News' Kyle Morris contributed to this update.President Biden will deliver remarks on the Israel-Hamas war Tuesday after the White House announced at least 11 Americans were killed in Saturday's unprecedented attack.""Hundreds of innocent civilians were murdered, including at least 11 American citizens, and there are other American citizens who remain unaccounted for,"" White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters earlier.""The U.S. government is doing everything we can to determine the whereabouts of these U.S. citizens,"" he added.After Hamas launched thousands of rockets and invaded the Jewish State on Saturday, Biden directed military aid to be sent to Israel.

I’m sorry.""Rachel Golberg told reporters gathered in Tel Aviv that the messages from her son Hersh Golberg-Polin came into her phone Saturday morning and that she has not heard from him since.""There were two texts in a row from Hersh at 8:11. The first one said, 'I love you.'... also, it said, 'I'm sorry'. And so I knew immediately, wherever he was, it was a terrible situation,"" Golberg said. ""I took it to mean I love you and I'm sorry because whatever is going to happen is going to cause you tremendous pain and worry.""""Since that time, I, of course, tried calling him right back. There was no answer. I texted him a couple of times. Are you okay? I've not heard from him since the text I received at 8:11 on Saturday morning,"" she added.Golberg said Golberg-Polin was attending the music festival in southern Israel on Saturday that was attacked by Hamas, leaving more than 250 dead.Golberg added that after speaking with witnesses, she learned that her son had tried to take cover in a bomb shelter and ended up losing his arm from the elbow down after getting caught in a ""gun battle"" there.""Hamas came in after the gunfire settled down and said anyone who can walk, stand up and walk out,"" she said.""We are told that he was completely calm. I think he was probably in shock. And he got up and he walked out with five other people, young people from the music festival, two young women, three other young men,"" Golberg said. ""They were put on a pickup truck and driven away by Hamas. Then the police told us one thing they knew is that the last known cell signal from his phone was on the border with Gaza.""Jon Polin, his father, described Golberg-Polin as a ""smiley, fun-loving guy"" who people gravitated toward.Fox News' Greg Norman contributed to this update.Israeli Defense Forces said approximately 15 rockets were fired into northern Israel from Lebanese territory.The IDF Aerial Defense Array successfully intercepted four rocket launches, while 10 more fell into open areas.IDF responded with artillery fire into Lebanon. The retaliatory strikes targeted two observation posts operated by the terrorist organization Hezbollah, IDF said.""The IDF is prepared for scenarios in all sectors and will continue to protect the residents of the State of Israel,"" officials said.Hamas and Hezbollah, both considered terrorist organizations by the U.S. government, share a goal of Israel's destruction, but they are not the same group.Hamas is an Iranian-backed Palestinian group designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). Hezbollah is a militant Lebanese group with a stronghold in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah is also backed by Iran.While both groups have a shared mission to eradicate Israel, Hamas primarily focuses on establishing a Palestinian state. Hezbollah has a broader goal of bolstering Iranian objectives.They also follow different sects of Islam. Hamas is mainly Sunni, and Hezbollah is a Shiite group.Fox News' Breana Scheckwitz contributed to this report.Anti-Israel demonstrators confronted counter-protesters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Monday, with one man calling the pro-Israel side ""Nazis"" and ""pigs.""""Animals, animals, you pigs, animals, Nazis, Nazis, Nazis,"" the man wearing a keffiyeh with Palestinian colors shouted at the Israel flag-carrying counter-protests across the street.The demonstration was held at Cambridge City Hall, half a mile away from Harvard University where more than two dozen student organizations declared Saturday that Israel is ""entirely responsible"" for the ongoing Israel-Gaza war.Pro-Palestinian protests

General Assembly resolutions envisaging the creation of an independent Palestinian state.Putin's comments echo those of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who at the United Nations General Assembly accused the United States and the West of continuing to ""fuel conflicts"" that ""divide humanity.""""The U.S. and its subordinate Western collective are continuing to fuel conflicts which artificially divide humanity into hostile blocks and hamper the achievement of overall aims,"" Lavrov said.

, as Israel works to defend itself from an unprecedented attack by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists, has called into question whether Speaker Pro Tempore Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., could or should receive an intelligence briefing about the situation.A source told Fox News that the Biden administration could take the line that there is no speaker for the House of Representatives. Thus, McHenry would not qualify for an intelligence briefing.However, Fox was also told that President Biden's team sees McHenry as credible and a responsible individual, so even though he is not speaker, the administration may be willing to brief him.So far, there has been no call for an intelligence briefing on the Middle East for the Congressional ""Gang of 8."" That group consists of the House speaker, the House minority leader, the Senate majority leader, the Senate minority leader, and the chairs and top minority members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees.That said, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is overseas on a foreign trip to China.Fox is told that a ""Gang of 7"" could convene and leave the top figure in the House out, because there is technically no top figure in the House with the speakership in limbo.Fox has also heard from multiple lawmakers and congressional sources warning of potential problems for the U.S. should there be a need to respond to the Middle East situation or another foreign policy crisis.The House, currently led by McHenry in its absence of a speaker, could not advance any legislative measure related to the crisis should that be necessary.Fox News' Chad Pergram and Kyle Morris contributed to this update.Enes Kanter #13 of the Boston Celtics during the American national anthem prior to the first half of their NBA game against the Toronto Raptors at Scotiabank Arena on November 28, 2021 in Toronto, Canada.Former professional basketball player Enes Kanter Freedom condemned the Saturday attack on Israel that has killed at least 100 Israelis in an attack for which the Islamist movement Hamas is taking responsibility.A senior Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif, announced the start of the operation in which he called on Palestinians everywhere to attack the Israelis.""This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,"" he said in a broadcast on Hamas media, saying that 5,000 rockets had been launched.Kanter Freedom condemned the attacks in a written statement to Fox News Digital.""I’ve been closely monitoring what’s going on in the Middle East,"" Kanter Freedom said.

The two sides are using tanks, artillery and other heavy weapons in densely populated areas. Fighter jets swooped overhead and anti-aircraft fire lit up the skies as darkness fell.The toll could be much higher because there are many bodies in the streets around central Khartoum that no one can reach because of the clashes.

Nearby, at least 88 students and staffers have been trapped in the engineering college library at Khartoum University since the start of fighting, one of the students said in a video posted online Monday. One student was killed during clashes outside and another wounded, he said. They do not have food or water, he said, showing a room full of people sleeping on the floor.Even in a country with a long history of military coups, the scenes of fighting in the capital and its adjoining city Omdurman across the Nile River were unprecedented. The turmoil comes just days before Sudanese were to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the holiday marking the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting.The power struggle pits Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the commander of the armed forces, against Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group. The former allies jointly orchestrated an October 2021 military coup that derailed Sudan’s transition to democracy. The violence now threatens to throw the country into a wider civil conflict just as Sudanese were trying to revive the drive for a democratic, civilian government after decades of military rule.The U.S., the U.N. and others have called for a truce. Egypt, which backs Sudan's military, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — which forged close ties to the RSF in recent years as it sent thousands of fighters to support their war in Yemen — have also called for both sides to stand down.But both generals have thus far dug in, demanding the other's surrender and ruling out negotiations.A conflict between two Sudanese generals has left at least 180 people dead and another 1,800 injured. (AP Photo/Marwan Ali)Dagalo, whose forces grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias in Sudan’s Darfur region, portrayed himself in a statement on Twitter on Monday as a defender of democracy and branded Burhan as the aggressor and a ""radical Islamist.""

They have food for a few more days, but ""after that we don’t know what to do,"" she said.Residents said fierce fighting with artillery and other heavy weapons raged Monday afternoon in the Gabra neighborhood southwest of Khartoum. People were trapped and screaming inside their homes, said Asmaa al-Toum, a physician living in the area.Fighting has been particularly fierce around each side's main bases, located amid civilian areas, and at strategic government buildings.The military on Monday claimed to have secured the main television building in Omdurman, fending off RSF fighters trying to seize the building for days. State-run Sudan TV resumed broadcasting.The military scored a significant gain Sunday when the RSF said it abandoned its main barracks and base, in Omdurman, which the armed forces had pounded with airstrikes. Online videos Monday purported to show the bodies of dozens of men said to be RSF fighters at the base, strewn over beds, the floor of a clinic and outside in a yard. The authenticity of the videos could not be confirmed independently.The military and RSF were also fighting in most major centers around the country, including in the western Darfur region and parts of the north and the east, by the borders with Egypt and Ethiopia. Battles raged Monday around a strategic airbase in Merowe, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) northwest of the capital, with both sides claiming control of the facility.Only four years ago, Sudan inspired hope after a popular uprising helped depose long-time autocratic leader Omar al-Bashir.But the turmoil since, especially the 2021 coup, has frustrated the democracy drive and wrecked the economy. A third of the population — around 16 million people — now depends on humanitarian assistance in the resource-rich nation, Africa's third largest.Save the Children, an international charity, said it has temporarily suspended most of its operations across Sudan. It said looters raided its offices in Darfur, stealing medical supplies, laptops, vehicles and a refrigerator.
